He ate locusts and wild honey. <verse number="7" style="v" />He preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen. <verse number="8" style="v" />I baptised you in<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:8 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">The Greek word (en) translated here as “in” could also be translated as “with” in some contexts.</char></note> water, but he will baptise you in the Holy Spirit.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptised by John in the Jordan. <verse number="10" style="v" />Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. <verse number="11" style="v" />A voice came out of the sky, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”</para>

    <verse number="12" style="v" />Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness. <verse number="13" style="v" />He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him.</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" />They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught. <verse number="22" style="v" />They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes. <verse number="23" style="v" />Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, <verse number="24" style="v" />saying, “Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!”</para>

    <verse number="26" style="v" />The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. <verse number="27" style="v" />They were all amazed, so that they questioned amongst themselves, saying, “What is this?

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="29" style="v" />Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. <verse number="30" style="v" />Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. <verse number="31" style="v" />He came and took her by the hand and raised her up.

    <verse number="32" style="v" />At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick and those who were possessed by demons. <verse number="33" style="v" />All the city was gathered together at the door. <verse number="34" style="v" />He healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="35" style="v" />Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there. <verse number="36" style="v" />Simon and those who were with him searched for him. <verse number="37" style="v" />They found him and told him, “Everyone is looking for you.”</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="45" style="v" />But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places. People came to him from everywhere.</para>
  <chapter number="2" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />When he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was at home. <verse number="2" style="v" />Immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke the word to them. <verse number="3" style="v" />Four people came, carrying a paralytic to him. <verse number="4" style="v" />When they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on. <verse number="5" style="v" />Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, <char style="wj">“Son, your sins are forgiven you.”</char></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" />But there were some of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, <verse number="7" style="v" />“Why does this man speak blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, <char style="wj">“Why do you reason these things in your hearts? </char> <verse number="9" style="v" /><char style="wj">Which is easier, to tell the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?’ </char> <verse number="10" style="v" /><char style="wj">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”</char>—he said to the paralytic— <verse number="11" style="v" /><char style="wj">“I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house.” </char></para>

    <verse number="13" style="v" />He went out again by the seaside. All the multitude came to him, and he taught them. <verse number="14" style="v" />As he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office. He said to him, <char style="wj">“Follow me.”</char> And he arose and followed him.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />He was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him. <verse number="16" style="v" />The scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, “Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" />When Jesus heard it, he said to them, <char style="wj">“Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”</char></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="18" style="v" />John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked him, “Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don’t fast?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />Jesus said to them, <char style="wj">“Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them?

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" />He was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain. <verse number="24" style="v" />The Pharisees said to him, “Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="25" style="v" />He said to them, <char style="wj">“Did you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry—he, and those who were with him? </char> <verse number="26" style="v" /><char style="wj">How he entered into God’s house at the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?”</char></para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered. <verse number="2" style="v" />They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him. <verse number="3" style="v" />He said to the man who had his hand withered, <char style="wj">“Stand up.”</char> <verse number="4" style="v" />He said to them, <char style="wj">“Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good or to do harm?

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples; and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea, <verse number="8" style="v" />from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him. <verse number="9" style="v" />He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn’t press on him. <verse number="10" style="v" />For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him. <verse number="11" style="v" />The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him and cried, “You are the Son of God!” <verse number="12" style="v" />He sternly warned them that they should not make him known.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />He went up into the mountain and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him. <verse number="14" style="v" />He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach <verse number="15" style="v" />and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons: <verse number="16" style="v" />Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter); <verse number="17" style="v" />James the son of Zebedee; and John, the brother of James, (whom he called Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder); <verse number="18" style="v" />Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot; <verse number="19" style="v" />and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</para>
  <para style="p">Then he came into a house. <verse number="20" style="v" />The multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. <verse number="21" style="v" />When his friends heard it, they went out to seize him; for they said, “He is insane.” <verse number="22" style="v" />The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul,” and, “By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.”</para>
