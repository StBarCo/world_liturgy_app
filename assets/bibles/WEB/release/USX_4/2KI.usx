    <verse number="1" style="v" />Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. <verse number="2" style="v" />Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper room that was in Samaria, and was sick. So he sent messengers, and said to them, “Go, enquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover of this sickness.”</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />The messengers returned to him, and he said to them, “Why is it that you have returned?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" />They said to him, “A man came up to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent you, and tell him, “The LORD says, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you send to enquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.’”’”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />He said to them, “What kind of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />They answered him, “He was a hairy man, and wearing a leather belt around his waist.”</para>
  <para style="p">He said, “It’s Elijah the Tishbite.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />Then the king sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!” Then fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />Again he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. He answered him, “Man of God, the king has said, ‘Come down quickly!’”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />Elijah answered them, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!” Then God’s fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />Again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, “Man of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty of your servants, be precious in your sight. <verse number="14" style="v" />Behold, fire came down from the sky, and consumed the last two captains of fifty with their fifties. But now let my life be precious in your sight.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />The LORD’s angel said to Elijah, “Go down with him. Don’t be afraid of him.”</para>
  <para style="p">Then he arose, and went down with him to the king. <verse number="16" style="v" />He said to him, “The LORD says, ‘Because you have sent messengers to enquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.’”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" />So he died according to the LORD’s word which Elijah had spoken. Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, because he had no son. <verse number="18" style="v" />Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />When the LORD was about to take Elijah up by a whirlwind into heaven, Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. <verse number="2" style="v" />Elijah said to Elisha, “Please wait here, for the LORD has sent me as far as Bethel.”</para>

  <para style="p">He said, “As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” Then they both went on. <verse number="7" style="v" />Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood opposite them at a distance; and they both stood by the Jordan. <verse number="8" style="v" />Elijah took his mantle, and rolled it up, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that they both went over on dry ground. <verse number="9" style="v" />When they had gone over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you.”</para>
  <para style="p">Elisha said, “Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me.”</para>
  <para style="p">

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />As they continued on and talked, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them, and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. <verse number="12" style="v" />Elisha saw it, and he cried, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!”</para>
  <para style="p">He saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces. <verse number="13" style="v" />He also took up Elijah’s mantle that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan. <verse number="14" style="v" />He took Elijah’s mantle that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, “Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?” When he also had struck the waters, they were divided apart, and Elisha went over. <verse number="15" style="v" />When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho facing him saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him. <verse number="16" style="v" />They said to him, “See now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. Perhaps the LORD’s Spirit has taken him up, and put him on some mountain, or into some valley.”</para>
  <para style="p">He said, “Don’t send them.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" />When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, “Send them.”</para>
  <para style="p">Therefore they sent fifty men; and they searched for three days, but didn’t find him. <verse number="18" style="v" />They came back to him, while he stayed at Jericho; and he said to them, “Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t go?’”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />The men of the city said to Elisha, “Behold, please, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is barren.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />He said, “Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it.” Then they brought it to him. <verse number="21" style="v" />He went out to the spring of the waters, and threw salt into it, and said, “The LORD says, ‘I have healed these waters. There shall not be from there any more death or barren wasteland.’” <verse number="22" style="v" />So the waters were healed to this day, according to Elisha’s word which he spoke.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" />He went up from there to Bethel. As he was going up by the way, some youths came out of the city and mocked him, and said to him, “Go up, you baldy! Go up, you baldy!” <verse number="24" style="v" />He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the LORD’s name. Then two female bears came out of the woods, and mauled forty-two of those youths. <verse number="25" style="v" />He went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</para>
  <chapter number="3" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years. <verse number="2" style="v" />He did that which was evil in the LORD’s sight, but not like his father, and like his mother, for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made. <verse number="3" style="v" />Nevertheless he held to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. He didn’t depart from them. <verse number="4" style="v" />Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder; and he supplied the king of Israel with the wool of one hundred thousand lambs, and of one hundred thousand rams. <verse number="5" style="v" />But when Ahab was dead, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. <verse number="6" style="v" />King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel. <verse number="7" style="v" />He went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me against Moab to battle?”</para>
  <para style="p">He said, “I will go up. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.” <verse number="8" style="v" />He said, “Which way shall we go up?”</para>
  <para style="p">He answered, “The way of the wilderness of Edom.” <verse number="9" style="v" />So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom, and they marched for seven days along a circuitous route. There was no water for the army or for the animals that followed them. <verse number="10" style="v" />The king of Israel said, “Alas! For the LORD has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there a prophet of the LORD here, that we may enquire of the LORD by him?”</para>
  <para style="p">One of the king of Israel’s servants answered, “Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah, is here.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />Jehoshaphat said, “The LORD’s word is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother.”</para>
  <para style="p">The king of Israel said to him, “No, for the LORD has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.” <verse number="14" style="v" />Elisha said, “As the LORD of Armies lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I respect the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look towards you, nor see you. <verse number="15" style="v" />But now bring me a musician.” When the musician played, the LORD’s hand came on him. <verse number="16" style="v" />He said, “The LORD says, ‘Make this valley full of trenches.’ <verse number="17" style="v" />For the LORD says, ‘You will not see wind, neither will you see rain, yet that valley will be filled with water, and you will drink, both you and your livestock and your other animals. <verse number="18" style="v" />This is an easy thing in the LORD’s sight. He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand. <verse number="19" style="v" />You shall strike every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.’”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />In the morning, about the time of offering the sacrifice, behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" />Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armour, young and old, and stood on the border. <verse number="22" style="v" />They rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood. <verse number="23" style="v" />They said, “This is blood. The kings are surely destroyed, and they have struck each other. Now therefore, Moab, to the plunder!”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="24" style="v" />When they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land attacking the Moabites. <verse number="25" style="v" />They beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land each man cast his stone, and filled it. They also stopped all the springs of water, and cut down all the good trees, until in Kir Hareseth all they left was its stones; however the men armed with slings went around it, and attacked it. <verse number="26" style="v" />When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew a sword, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not. <verse number="27" style="v" />Then he took his oldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. There was great wrath against Israel; and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Now a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, “Your servant my husband is dead. You know that your servant feared the LORD. Now the creditor has come to take for himself my two children to be slaves.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="2" style="v" />Elisha said to her, “What should I do for you? Tell me: what do you have in the house?”</para>
  <para style="p">She said, “Your servant has nothing in the house, except a pot of oil.”</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />So she went from him, and shut the door on herself and on her sons. They brought the containers to her, and she poured oil. <verse number="6" style="v" />When the containers were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another container.”</para>
  <para style="p">He said to her, “There isn’t another container.” Then the oil stopped flowing.</para>

    <verse number="8" style="v" />One day Elisha went to Shunem, where there was a prominent woman; and she persuaded him to eat bread. So it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread. <verse number="9" style="v" />She said to her husband, “See now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God who passes by us continually. <verse number="10" style="v" />Please let’s make a little room on the roof. Let’s set a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp stand for him there. When he comes to us, he can stay there.”</para>

  <para style="p">She answered, “I dwell amongst my own people.”</para>

  <para style="p">She said, “No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your servant.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" />The woman conceived, and bore a son at that season, when the time came around, as Elisha had said to her. <verse number="18" style="v" />When the child was grown, one day he went out to his father to the reapers. <verse number="19" style="v" />He said to his father, “My head!

  <para style="p">He said to his servant, “Carry him to his mother.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />When he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died. <verse number="21" style="v" />She went up and laid him on the man of God’s bed, and shut the door on him, and went out. <verse number="22" style="v" />She called to her husband, and said, “Please send me one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" />He said, “Why would you want go to him today? It is not a new moon or a Sabbath.”</para>
  <para style="p">She said, “It’s all right.”</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="25" style="v" />So she went, and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel.

    <verse number="32" style="v" />When Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and lying on his bed. <verse number="33" style="v" />He went in therefore, and shut the door on them both, and prayed to the LORD. <verse number="34" style="v" />He went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. He stretched himself on him; and the child’s flesh grew warm. <verse number="35" style="v" />Then he returned, and walked in the house once back and forth; and went up, and stretched himself out on him.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="39" style="v" />One went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered a lap full of wild gourds from it, and came and cut them up into the pot of stew; for they didn’t recognise them. <verse number="40" style="v" />So they poured out for the men to eat.

  <para style="p">
