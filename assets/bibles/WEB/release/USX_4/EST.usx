    <verse number="1" style="v" />Now in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces), <verse number="2" style="v" />in those days, when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Susa the palace, <verse number="3" style="v" />in the third year of his reign, he made a feast for all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him. <verse number="4" style="v" />He displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even one hundred and eighty days. <verse number="5" style="v" />When these days were fulfilled, the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Susa the palace, both great and small, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace. <verse number="6" style="v" />There were hangings of white and blue material, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and marble pillars. The couches were of gold and silver, on a pavement of red, white, yellow, and black marble. <verse number="7" style="v" />They gave them drinks in golden vessels of various kinds, including royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king. <verse number="8" style="v" />In accordance with the law, the drinking was not compulsory; for so the king had instructed all the officials of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcass, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king, <verse number="11" style="v" />to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown, to show the people and the princes her beauty; for she was beautiful. <verse number="12" style="v" />But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by the eunuchs. Therefore the king was very angry, and his anger burnt in him.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times (for it was the king’s custom to consult those who knew law and judgement; <verse number="14" style="v" />and next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king’s face, and sat first in the kingdom), <verse number="15" style="v" />“What shall we do to Queen Vashti according to law, because she has not done the bidding of the King Ahasuerus by the eunuchs?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="16" style="v" />Memucan answered before the king and the princes, “Vashti the queen has not done wrong to just the king, but also to all the princes, and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus. <verse number="17" style="v" />For this deed of the queen will become known to all women, causing them to show contempt for their husbands, when it is reported, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she didn’t come.’ <verse number="18" style="v" />Today, the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen’s deed will tell all the king’s princes. This will cause much contempt and wrath.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />“If it pleases the king, let a royal commandment go from him, and let it be written amongst the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it cannot be altered, that Vashti may never again come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another who is better than she. <verse number="20" style="v" />When the king’s decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give their husbands honour, both great and small.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" />This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan: <verse number="22" style="v" />for he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, that every man should rule his own house, speaking in the language of his own people.</para>
  <chapter number="2" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her. <verse number="2" style="v" />Then the king’s servants who served him said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king. <verse number="3" style="v" />Let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the beautiful young virgins to the citadel of Susa, to the women’s house, to the custody of Hegai the king’s eunuch, keeper of the women. Let cosmetics be given them; <verse number="4" style="v" />and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” The thing pleased the king, and he did so.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />There was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite, <verse number="6" style="v" />who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away. <verse number="7" style="v" />He brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter; for she had neither father nor mother. The maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />So, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to the citadel of Susa, to the custody of Hegai, Esther was taken into the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women. <verse number="9" style="v" />The maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him. He quickly gave her cosmetics and her portions of food, and the seven choice maidens who were to be given her out of the king’s house. He moved her and her maidens to the best place in the women’s house. <verse number="10" style="v" />Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives, because Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make it known. <verse number="11" style="v" />Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women’s house, to find out how Esther was doing, and what would become of her.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />Each young woman’s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after her purification for twelve months (for so were the days of their purification accomplished, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet fragrances and with preparations for beautifying women). <verse number="13" style="v" />The young woman then came to the king like this: whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women’s house to the king’s house. <verse number="14" style="v" />In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned into the second women’s house, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch, who kept the concubines. She came in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she was called by name. <verse number="15" style="v" />Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s eunuch, the keeper of the women, advised. Esther obtained favour in the sight of all those who looked at her.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="16" style="v" />So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. <verse number="17" style="v" />The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained favour and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="18" style="v" />Then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces, and gave gifts according to the king’s bounty.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />When the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate. <verse number="20" style="v" />Esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people, as Mordecai had commanded her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai, like she did when she was brought up by him. <verse number="21" style="v" />In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, two of the king’s eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, who were doorkeepers, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus. <verse number="22" style="v" />This thing became known to Mordecai, who informed Esther the queen; and Esther informed the king in Mordecai’s name. <verse number="23" style="v" />When this matter was investigated, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a gallows; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the king’s presence.</para>
  <chapter number="3" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes who were with him. <verse number="2" style="v" />All the king’s servants who were in the king’s gate bowed down, and paid homage to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai didn’t bow down or pay him homage. <verse number="3" style="v" />Then the king’s servants, who were in the king’s gate, said to Mordecai, “Why do you disobey the king’s commandment?” <verse number="4" style="v" />Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he didn’t listen to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew. <verse number="5" style="v" />When Haman saw that Mordecai didn’t bow down, nor pay him homage, Haman was full of wrath. <verse number="6" style="v" />But he scorned the thought of laying hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to him Mordecai’s people. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even Mordecai’s people.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, and chose the twelfth month, which is the month Adar. <verse number="8" style="v" />Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed amongst the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, and their laws are different from other people’s. They don’t keep the king’s laws. Therefore it is not for the king’s profit to allow them to remain. <verse number="9" style="v" />If it pleases the king, let it be written that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">3:9 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds or 965 Troy ounces</char></note> of silver into the hands of those who are in charge of the king’s business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />The king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy. <verse number="11" style="v" />The king said to Haman, “The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />Then the king’s scribes were called in on the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month; and all that Haman commanded was written to the king’s local governors, and to the governors who were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus, and it was sealed with the king’s ring. <verse number="13" style="v" />Letters were sent by couriers into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to plunder their possessions. <verse number="14" style="v" />A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day. <verse number="15" style="v" />The couriers went out in haste by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Susa was perplexed.</para>
  <chapter number="4" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Now when Mordecai found out all that was done, Mordecai tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the middle of the city, and wailed loudly and bitterly. <verse number="2" style="v" />He came even before the king’s gate, for no one is allowed inside the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth. <verse number="3" style="v" />In every province, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning amongst the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />Esther’s maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this, and the queen was exceedingly grieved. She sent clothing to Mordecai, to replace his sackcloth; but he didn’t receive it. <verse number="5" style="v" />Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs, whom he had appointed to attend her, and commanded him to go to Mordecai, to find out what this was, and why it was. <verse number="6" style="v" />So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to city square which was before the king’s gate. <verse number="7" style="v" />Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the destruction of the Jews. <verse number="8" style="v" />He also gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Susa to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to urge her to go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him, for her people.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai. <verse number="10" style="v" />Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai: <verse number="11" style="v" />“All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces know that whoever, whether man or woman, comes to the king into the inner court without being called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king might hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live. I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />They told Esther’s words to Mordecai. <verse number="13" style="v" />Then Mordecai asked them to return this answer to Esther: “Don’t think to yourself that you will escape in the king’s house any more than all the Jews. <verse number="14" style="v" />For if you remain silent now, then relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another place, but you and your father’s house will perish. Who knows if you haven’t come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />Then Esther asked them to answer Mordecai, <verse number="16" style="v" />“Go, gather together all the Jews who are present in Susa, and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. I and my maidens will also fast the same way. Then I will go in to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish.” <verse number="17" style="v" />So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</para>
  <chapter number="5" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Now on the third day, Esther put on her royal clothing, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, next to the king’s house. The king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, next to the entrance of the house. <verse number="2" style="v" />When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she obtained favour in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther came near, and touched the top of the sceptre. <verse number="3" style="v" />Then the king asked her, “What would you like, queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />Esther said, “If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />Then the king said, “Bring Haman quickly, so that it may be done as Esther has said.” So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" />The king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, “What is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />Then Esther answered and said, “My petition and my request is this. <verse number="8" style="v" />If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />Then Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart, but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he didn’t stand up nor move for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai. <verse number="10" style="v" />Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home. There, he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife. <verse number="11" style="v" />Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, the multitude of his children, all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king. <verse number="12" style="v" />Haman also said, “Yes, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow I am also invited by her together with the king. <verse number="13" style="v" />Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, “Let a gallows be made fifty cubits<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">5:14 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimetres.</char></note> high, and in the morning speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on it. Then go in merrily with the king to the banquet.” This pleased Haman, so he had the gallows made.</para>
  <chapter number="6" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />On that night, the king couldn’t sleep. He commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought, and they were read to the king. <verse number="2" style="v" />It was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs, who were doorkeepers, who had tried to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus. <verse number="3" style="v" />The king said, “What honour and dignity has been given to Mordecai for this?”</para>
  <para style="p">Then the king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />The king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had come into the outer court of the king’s house, to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />The king’s servants said to him, “Behold,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">6:5 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">“Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.

  <para style="p">The king said, “Let him come in.” <verse number="6" style="v" />So Haman came in. The king said to him, “What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honour?”</para>
  <para style="p">Now Haman said in his heart, “Who would the king delight to honour more than myself?” <verse number="7" style="v" />Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king delights to honour, <verse number="8" style="v" />let royal clothing be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides on, and on the head of which a royal crown is set. <verse number="9" style="v" />Let the clothing and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man whom the king delights to honour with them, and have him ride on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him, ‘Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honour!’”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />Then the king said to Haman, “Hurry and take the clothing and the horse, as you have said, and do this for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king’s gate. Let nothing fail of all that you have spoken.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />Then Haman took the clothing and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and had him ride through the city square, and proclaimed before him, “Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honour!”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />Mordecai came back to the king’s gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning and having his head covered. <verse number="13" style="v" />Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against him, but you will surely fall before him.” <verse number="14" style="v" />While they were yet talking with him, the king’s eunuchs came, and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</para>
  <chapter number="7" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen. <verse number="2" style="v" />The king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, “What is your petition, queen Esther? It shall be granted you. What is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" />Then Esther the queen answered, “If I have found favour in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request. <verse number="4" style="v" />For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish.

  <para style="p">Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen. <verse number="7" style="v" />The king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden.
