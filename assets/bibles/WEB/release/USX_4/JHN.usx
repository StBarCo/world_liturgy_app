    <verse number="1" style="v" />In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <verse number="2" style="v" />The same was in the beginning with God. <verse number="3" style="v" />All things were made through him. Without him, nothing was made that has been made. <verse number="4" style="v" />In him was life, and the life was the light of men. <verse number="5" style="v" />The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn’t overcome<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:5 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">The word translated “overcome” (κατέλαβεν) can also be translated “comprehended.” It refers to getting a grip on an enemy to defeat him. </char></note> it. <verse number="6" style="v" />There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John. <verse number="7" style="v" />The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe through him. <verse number="8" style="v" />He was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light. <verse number="9" style="v" />The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world didn’t recognise him. <verse number="11" style="v" />He came to his own, and those who were his own didn’t receive him. <verse number="12" style="v" />But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become God’s children, to those who believe in his name: <verse number="13" style="v" />who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. <verse number="14" style="v" />The Word became flesh, and lived amongst us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth. <verse number="15" style="v" />John testified about him. He cried out, saying, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.’” <verse number="16" style="v" />From his fullness we all received grace upon grace. <verse number="17" style="v" />For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth were realised through Jesus Christ. <verse number="18" style="v" />No one has seen God at any time. The one and only Son,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:18 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">NU reads “God”</char></note> who is in the bosom of the Father, has declared him.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />This is John’s testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />He declared, and didn’t deny, but he declared, “I am not the Christ.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" />They asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?”</para>
  <para style="p">He said, “I am not.”</para>
  <para style="p">“Are you the prophet?”</para>
  <para style="p">He answered, “No.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />They said therefore to him, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" />He said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’<note caller="+" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">1:23 </char><char style="xt" closed="false"><ref loc="ISA 40:3">Isaiah 40:3</ref></char></note> as Isaiah the prophet said.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="24" style="v" />The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees. <verse number="25" style="v" />They asked him, “Why then do you baptise, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="26" style="v" />John answered them, “I baptise in water, but amongst you stands one whom you don’t know. <verse number="27" style="v" />He is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I’m not worthy to loosen.” <verse number="28" style="v" />These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptising.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="29" style="v" />The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, “Behold,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:29 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">“Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="35" style="v" />Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples, <verse number="36" style="v" />and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” <verse number="37" style="v" />The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. <verse number="38" style="v" />Jesus turned and saw them following, and said to them, <char style="wj">“What are you looking for?”</char></para>
  <para style="p">They said to him, “Rabbi” (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), “where are you staying?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="39" style="v" />He said to them, <char style="wj">“Come, and see.”</char></para>
  <para style="p">They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day.

Jesus said to him, <char style="wj">“Follow me.”</char> <verse number="44" style="v" />Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter. <verse number="45" style="v" />Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, “We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="46" style="v" />Nathanael said to him, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?”</para>
  <para style="p">Philip said to him, “Come and see.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="47" style="v" />Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him, <char style="wj">“Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!”</char></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="48" style="v" />Nathanael said to him, “How do you know me?”</para>
  <para style="p">Jesus answered him, <char style="wj">“Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”</char></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="49" style="v" />Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="50" style="v" />Jesus answered him, <char style="wj">“Because I told you, ‘I saw you underneath the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these!”</char> <verse number="51" style="v" />He said to him, <char style="wj">“Most certainly, I tell you all, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”</char></para>
  <chapter number="2" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />The third day, there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there. <verse number="2" style="v" />Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the wedding. <verse number="3" style="v" />When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no wine.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />Jesus said to her, <char style="wj">“Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My hour has not yet come.”</char></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />His mother said to the servants, “Whatever he says to you, do it.” <verse number="6" style="v" />Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews’ way of purifying, containing two or three metretes<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">2:6 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">2 to 3 metretes is about 20 to 30 U.

You have kept the good wine until now!” <verse number="11" style="v" />This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and they stayed there a few days. <verse number="13" style="v" />The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <verse number="14" style="v" />He found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting. <verse number="15" style="v" />He made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers’ money and overthrew their tables. <verse number="16" style="v" />To those who sold the doves, he said, <char style="wj">“Take these things out of here! Don’t make my Father’s house a marketplace!”</char> <verse number="17" style="v" />His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will eat me up.”<note caller="+" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">2:17 </char><char style="xt" closed="false"><ref loc="PSA 69:9">Psalm 69:9</ref></char></note></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="18" style="v" />The Jews therefore answered him, “What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />Jesus answered them, <char style="wj">“Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”</char></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />The Jews therefore said, “It took forty-six years to build this temple! Will you raise it up in three days?” <verse number="21" style="v" />But he spoke of the temple of his body. <verse number="22" style="v" />When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" />Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, observing his signs which he did. <verse number="24" style="v" />But Jesus didn’t entrust himself to them, because he knew everyone, <verse number="25" style="v" />and because he didn’t need for anyone to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.</para>
  <chapter number="3" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. <verse number="2" style="v" />The same came to him by night, and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" />Jesus answered him, <char style="wj">“Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is born anew, </char><note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">3:3 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">The word translated “anew” here and in John 3:7 (ἄνωθεν) also means “again” and “from above”.</char></note> <char style="wj">he can’t see God’s Kingdom.”</char></para>

    <verse number="5" style="v" />Jesus answered, <char style="wj">“Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit, he can’t enter into God’s Kingdom.</char> <verse number="6" style="v" /><char style="wj">That which is born of the flesh is flesh.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />After these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea. He stayed there with them and baptised. <verse number="23" style="v" />John also was baptising in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. They came, and were baptised; <verse number="24" style="v" />for John was not yet thrown into prison. <verse number="25" style="v" />Therefore a dispute arose on the part of John’s disciples with some Jews about purification. <verse number="26" style="v" />They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, he baptises, and everyone is coming to him.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="27" style="v" />John answered, “A man can receive nothing unless it has been given him from heaven. <verse number="28" style="v" />You yourselves testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but, ‘I have been sent before him.’ <verse number="29" style="v" />He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. This, my joy, therefore is made full. <verse number="30" style="v" />He must increase, but I must decrease. <verse number="31" style="v" />He who comes from above is above all. He who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all. <verse number="32" style="v" />What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness. <verse number="33" style="v" />He who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true. <verse number="34" style="v" />For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure. <verse number="35" style="v" />The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand. <verse number="36" style="v" />One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">3:36 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">The same word can be translated “disobeys” or “disbelieves” in this context.</char></note> the Son won’t see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.”</para>
  <chapter number="4" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptising more disciples than John <verse number="2" style="v" />(although Jesus himself didn’t baptise, but his disciples), <verse number="3" style="v" />he left Judea and departed into Galilee. <verse number="4" style="v" />He needed to pass through Samaria. <verse number="5" style="v" />So he came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son, Joseph. <verse number="6" style="v" />Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">4:6 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">noon</char></note> <verse number="7" style="v" />A woman of Samaria came to draw water.

He stayed there two days. <verse number="41" style="v" />Many more believed because of his word. <verse number="42" style="v" />They said to the woman, “Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.”</para>

There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum. <verse number="47" style="v" />When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. <verse number="48" style="v" />Jesus therefore said to him, <char style="wj">“Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way believe.”</char></para>
