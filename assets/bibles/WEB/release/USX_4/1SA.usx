  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. <verse number="2" style="v" />He had two wives. The name of one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. <verse number="3" style="v" />This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:3 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">When rendered in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, “LORD” or “GOD” is the translation of God’s Proper Name.</char></note> of Armies in Shiloh. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to the LORD, were there. <verse number="4" style="v" />When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters; <verse number="5" style="v" />but he gave a double portion to Hannah, for he loved Hannah, but the LORD had shut up her womb. <verse number="6" style="v" />Her rival provoked her severely, to irritate her, because the LORD had shut up her womb. <verse number="7" style="v" />So year by year, when she went up to the LORD’s house, her rival provoked her. Therefore she wept, and didn’t eat. <verse number="8" style="v" />Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? Why don’t you eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />So Hannah rose up after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of the LORD’s temple. <verse number="10" style="v" />She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the LORD, weeping bitterly. <verse number="11" style="v" />She vowed a vow, and said, “The LORD of Armies, if you will indeed look at the affliction of your servant and remember me, and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a boy, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall come on his head.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />As she continued praying before the LORD, Eli saw her mouth. <verse number="13" style="v" />Now Hannah spoke in her heart. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk. <verse number="14" style="v" />Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Get rid of your wine!”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have not been drinking wine or strong drink, but I poured out my soul before the LORD. <verse number="16" style="v" />Don’t consider your servant a wicked woman; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" />Then Eli answered, “Go in peace; and may the God<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:17 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</char></note> of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="18" style="v" />She said, “Let your servant find favour in your sight.” So the woman went her way and ate; and her facial expression wasn’t sad any more.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />They rose up in the morning early and worshipped the LORD, then returned and came to their house to Ramah. Then Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />When the time had come, Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she named him Samuel,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:20 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Samuel sounds like the Hebrew for “heard by God.”</char></note> saying, “Because I have asked him of the LORD.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" />The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and his vow. <verse number="22" style="v" />But Hannah didn’t go up, for she said to her husband, “Not until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and stay there forever.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" />Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems good to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only may the LORD establish his word.”</para>
  <para style="p">So the woman waited and nursed her son until she weaned him. <verse number="24" style="v" />When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, and one ephah<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:24 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">1 ephah is about 22 litres or about 2/3 of a bushel</char></note> of meal, and a container of wine, and brought him to the LORD’s house in Shiloh. The child was young. <verse number="25" style="v" />They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli. <verse number="26" style="v" />She said, “Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to the LORD. <verse number="27" style="v" />I prayed for this child, and the LORD has given me my petition which I asked of him. <verse number="28" style="v" />Therefore I have also given him to the LORD. As long as he lives he is given to the LORD.” He worshipped the LORD there.</para>

    <verse number="11" style="v" />Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. The child served the LORD before Eli the priest.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />Now the sons of Eli were wicked men. They didn’t know the LORD. <verse number="13" style="v" />The custom of the priests with the people was that when anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant came while the meat was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand; <verse number="14" style="v" />and he stabbed it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot. The priest took all that the fork brought up for himself. They did this to all the Israelites who came there to Shiloh. <verse number="15" style="v" />Yes, before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, “Give meat to roast for the priest; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="16" style="v" />If the man said to him, “Let the fat be burnt first, and then take as much as your soul desires;” then he would say, “No, but you shall give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force.” <verse number="17" style="v" />The sin of the young men was very great before the LORD; for the men despised the LORD’s offering. <verse number="18" style="v" />But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, clothed with a linen ephod. <verse number="19" style="v" />Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. <verse number="20" style="v" />Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, “May The LORD give you offspring<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">2:20 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">or, seed</char></note> from this woman for the petition which was asked of the LORD.” Then they went to their own home. <verse number="21" style="v" />The LORD visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew before the LORD.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they slept with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting. <verse number="23" style="v" />He said to them, “Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all these people. <verse number="24" style="v" />No, my sons; for it is not a good report that I hear! You make the LORD’s people disobey. <verse number="25" style="v" />If one man sins against another, God will judge him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who will intercede for him?” Notwithstanding, they didn’t listen to the voice of their father, because the LORD intended to kill them.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="26" style="v" />The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favour both with the LORD and also with men.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="27" style="v" />A man of God came to Eli and said to him, “The LORD says, ‘Did I reveal myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house? <verse number="28" style="v" />Didn’t I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? Didn’t I give to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire? <verse number="29" style="v" />Why do you kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honour your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?’ <verse number="30" style="v" />“Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, says, ‘I said indeed that your house and the house of your father should walk before me forever.’ But now the LORD says, ‘Far be it from me; for those who honour me I will honour, and those who despise me will be cursed. <verse number="31" style="v" />Behold,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">2:31 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">“Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.

There shall not be an old man in your house forever. <verse number="33" style="v" />The man of yours whom I don’t cut off from my altar will consume your eyes<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">2:33 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">or, blind your eyes with tears</char></note> and grieve your heart. All the increase of your house will die in the flower of their age. <verse number="34" style="v" />This will be the sign to you that will come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they will both die. <verse number="35" style="v" />I will raise up a faithful priest for myself who will do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind. I will build him a sure house. He will walk before my anointed forever. <verse number="36" style="v" />It will happen that everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and will say, “Please put me into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.”’”</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />The child Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli. The LORD’s word was rare in those days. There were not many visions, then. <verse number="2" style="v" />At that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see), <verse number="3" style="v" />and God’s lamp hadn’t yet gone out, and Samuel had laid down in the LORD’s temple where God’s ark was, <verse number="4" style="v" />The LORD called Samuel.

He arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; for you called me.”</para>
  <para style="p">Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child. <verse number="9" style="v" />Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down.

Samuel!”</para>
  <para style="p">Then Samuel said, “Speak; for your servant hears.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />The LORD said to Samuel, “Behold, I will do a thing in Israel at which both the ears of everyone who hears it will tingle. <verse number="12" style="v" />In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end. <verse number="13" style="v" />For I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves, and he didn’t restrain them. <verse number="14" style="v" />Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be removed with sacrifice or offering forever.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the LORD’s house. Samuel was afraid to show Eli the vision. <verse number="16" style="v" />Then Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son!”</para>

  <para style="p">He said, “It is the LORD. Let him do what seems good to him.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground. <verse number="20" style="v" />All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD. <verse number="21" style="v" />The LORD appeared again in Shiloh; for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the LORD’s word.</para>
  <chapter number="4" style="c" />
  <para style="nb">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />The word of Samuel came to all Israel.</para>
  <para style="p">Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek. <verse number="2" style="v" />The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel. When they joined battle, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men of the army in the field. <verse number="3" style="v" />When the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the LORD defeated us today before the Philistines? Let’s get the ark of the LORD’s covenant out of Shiloh and bring it to us, that it may come amongst us and save us out of the hand of our enemies.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of Armies, who sits above the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God. <verse number="5" style="v" />When the ark of the LORD’s covenant came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth resounded. <verse number="6" style="v" />When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” They understood that the LORD’s ark had come into the camp. <verse number="7" style="v" />The Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp.” They said, “Woe to us! For there has not been such a thing before. <verse number="8" style="v" />Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. <verse number="9" style="v" />Be strong and behave like men, O you Philistines, that you not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Strengthen yourselves like men, and fight!” <verse number="10" style="v" />The Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and each man fled to his tent. There was a very great slaughter; for thirty thousand footmen of Israel fell. <verse number="11" style="v" />God’s ark was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.</para>

    <verse number="12" style="v" />A man of Benjamin ran out of the army and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn and with dirt on his head. <verse number="13" style="v" />When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching, for his heart trembled for God’s ark. When the man came into the city and told about it, all the city cried out. <verse number="14" style="v" />When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, “What does the noise of this tumult mean?”</para>
  <para style="p">The man hurried, and came and told Eli. <verse number="15" style="v" />Now Eli was ninety-eight years old. His eyes were set, so that he could not see. <verse number="16" style="v" />The man said to Eli, “I am he who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army.”</para>

    <verse number="18" style="v" />When he made mention of God’s ark, Eli fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck broke, and he died, for he was an old man and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.</para>

  <para style="p">They answered, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried over to Gath.” They carried the ark of the God of Israel there. <verse number="9" style="v" />It was so, that after they had carried it there, the LORD’s hand was against the city with a very great confusion; and he struck the men of the city, both small and great, so that tumours broke out on them. <verse number="10" style="v" />So they sent God’s ark to Ekron.</para>
  <para style="p">As God’s ark came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought the ark of the God of Israel here to us, to kill us and our people.” <verse number="11" style="v" />They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, “Send the ark of the God of Israel away, and let it go again to its own place, that it not kill us and our people.” For there was a deadly panic throughout all the city. The hand of God was very heavy there. <verse number="12" style="v" />The men who didn’t die were struck with the tumours; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.</para>
