    <verse number="3" style="v" />We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, <verse number="4" style="v" />having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which you have towards all the saints, <verse number="5" style="v" />because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the Good News <verse number="6" style="v" />which has come to you, even as it is in all the world and is bearing fruit and growing, as it does in you also, since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth, <verse number="7" style="v" />even as you learnt of Epaphras our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on your<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:7 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">NU reads </char><char style="fqa" closed="false">our</char></note> behalf, <verse number="8" style="v" />who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.</para>

    <verse number="9" style="v" />For this cause, we also, since the day we heard this, don’t cease praying and making requests for you, that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, <verse number="10" style="v" />that you may walk worthily of the Lord, to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God, <verse number="11" style="v" />strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, for all endurance and perseverance with joy, <verse number="12" style="v" />giving thanks to the Father, who made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, <verse number="13" style="v" />who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love, <verse number="14" style="v" />in whom we have our redemption,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:14 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">TR adds “through his blood,” </char></note> the forgiveness of our sins. <verse number="15" style="v" />He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. <verse number="16" style="v" />For by him all things were created in the heavens and on the earth, visible things and invisible things, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things have been created through him and for him. <verse number="17" style="v" />He is before all things, and in him all things are held together. <verse number="18" style="v" />He is the head of the body, the assembly, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence. <verse number="19" style="v" />For all the fullness was pleased to dwell in him, <verse number="20" style="v" />and through him to reconcile all things to himself by him, whether things on the earth or things in the heavens, having made peace through the blood of his cross.</para>

    <verse number="21" style="v" />You, being in past times alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil deeds, <verse number="22" style="v" />yet now he has reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without defect and blameless before him, <verse number="23" style="v" />if it is so that you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the Good News which you heard, which is being proclaimed in all creation under heaven, of which I, Paul, was made a servant.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="24" style="v" />Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the assembly, <verse number="25" style="v" />of which I was made a servant according to the stewardship of God which was given me towards you to fulfil the word of God, <verse number="26" style="v" />the mystery which has been hidden for ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to his saints, <verse number="27" style="v" />to whom God was pleased to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery amongst the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. <verse number="28" style="v" />We proclaim him, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus; <verse number="29" style="v" />for which I also labour, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily.</para>
  <chapter number="2" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />For I desire to have you know how greatly I struggle for you, and for those at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh; <verse number="2" style="v" />that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love, and gaining all riches of the full assurance of understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ, <verse number="3" style="v" />in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden. <verse number="4" style="v" />Now I say this that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech. <verse number="5" style="v" />For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in the spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" />As therefore you received Christ Jesus, the Lord, walk in him, <verse number="7" style="v" />rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, even as you were taught, abounding in it in thanksgiving.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />Be careful that you don’t let anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the elements of the world, and not after Christ. <verse number="9" style="v" />For in him all the fullness of the Deity dwells bodily, <verse number="10" style="v" />and in him you are made full, who is the head of all principality and power. <verse number="11" style="v" />In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ, <verse number="12" style="v" />having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead. <verse number="13" style="v" />You were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh. He made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, <verse number="14" style="v" />wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us. He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross. <verse number="15" style="v" />Having stripped the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="16" style="v" />Let no one therefore judge you in eating, or in drinking, or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day, <verse number="17" style="v" />which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ’s. <verse number="18" style="v" />Let no one rob you of your prize by self-abasement and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, <verse number="19" style="v" />and not holding firmly to the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and ligaments, grows with God’s growth.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances, <verse number="21" style="v" />“Don’t handle, nor taste, nor touch” <verse number="22" style="v" />(all of which perish with use), according to the precepts and doctrines of men? <verse number="23" style="v" />These things indeed appear like wisdom in self-imposed worship, humility, and severity to the body; but aren’t of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.</para>
  <chapter number="3" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />If then you were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God. <verse number="2" style="v" />Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth. <verse number="3" style="v" />For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. <verse number="4" style="v" />When Christ, our life, is revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: sexual immorality, uncleanness, depraved passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. <verse number="6" style="v" />For these things’ sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience. <verse number="7" style="v" />You also once walked in those, when you lived in them; <verse number="8" style="v" />but now you also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and shameful speaking out of your mouth. <verse number="9" style="v" />Don’t lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings, <verse number="10" style="v" />and have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator, <verse number="11" style="v" />where there can’t be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant, or free person; but Christ is all, and in all.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />Put on therefore, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and perseverance; <verse number="13" style="v" />bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, so you also do.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />Above all these things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection. <verse number="15" style="v" />And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body, and be thankful. <verse number="16" style="v" />Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the Lord.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" />Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father, through him.</para>

    <verse number="22" style="v" />Servants, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not just when they are looking, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God. <verse number="23" style="v" />And whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord, and not for men, <verse number="24" style="v" />knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ. <verse number="25" style="v" />But he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done, and there is no partiality.</para>
