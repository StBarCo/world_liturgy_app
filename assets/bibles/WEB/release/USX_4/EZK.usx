This was their appearance: They had the likeness of a man. <verse number="6" style="v" />Everyone had four faces, and each one of them had four wings. <verse number="7" style="v" />Their feet were straight feet. The sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like burnished bronze. <verse number="8" style="v" />They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides.

Each one had two which covered on this side, and each one had two which covered their bodies on that side. <verse number="24" style="v" />When they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of an army.
