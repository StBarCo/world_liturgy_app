    <verse number="1" style="v" />After this, David enquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?”</para>
  <para style="p">The LORD said to him, “Go up.”</para>
  <para style="p">David said, “Where shall I go up?”</para>
  <para style="p">He said, “To Hebron.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="2" style="v" />So David went up there with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. <verse number="3" style="v" />David brought up his men who were with him, every man with his household. They lived in the cities of Hebron. <verse number="4" style="v" />The men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. They told David, “The men of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul.” <verse number="5" style="v" />David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, “Blessed are you by the LORD, that you have shown this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him. <verse number="6" style="v" />Now may the LORD show loving kindness and truth to you. I also will reward you for this kindness, because you have done this thing. <verse number="7" style="v" />Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s army, had taken Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; <verse number="9" style="v" />and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel. <verse number="10" style="v" />Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David. <verse number="11" style="v" />The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months. <verse number="12" style="v" />Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. <verse number="13" style="v" />Joab the son of Zeruiah and David’s servants went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool. <verse number="14" style="v" />Abner said to Joab, “Please let the young men arise and play before us!”</para>
  <para style="p">Joab said, “Let them arise!” <verse number="15" style="v" />Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of David’s servants. <verse number="16" style="v" />They each caught his opponent by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together: therefore that place in Gibeon was called Helkath Hazzurim.<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">2:16 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">“Helkath Hazzurim” means “field of daggers”.</char></note> <verse number="17" style="v" />The battle was very severe that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before David’s servants. <verse number="18" style="v" />The three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild gazelle. <verse number="19" style="v" />Asahel pursued Abner; and in going he didn’t turn to the right hand or to the left from following Abner. <verse number="20" style="v" />Then Abner looked behind him, and said, “Is that you, Asahel?”</para>
  <para style="p">He answered, “It is.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" />Abner said to him, “Turn away to your right hand or to your left, and grab one of the young men, and take his armour.” But Asahel would not turn away from following him. <verse number="22" style="v" />Abner said again to Asahel, “Turn away from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I look Joab your brother in the face?” <verse number="23" style="v" />However he refused to turn away. Therefore Abner with the back end of the spear struck him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place. As many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still. <verse number="24" style="v" />But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. The sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon. <verse number="25" style="v" />The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill. <verse number="26" style="v" />Then Abner called to Joab, and said, “Shall the sword devour forever? Don’t you know that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long will it be then, before you ask the people to return from following their brothers?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="27" style="v" />Joab said, “As God<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">2:27 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</char></note> lives, if you had not spoken, surely then in the morning the people would have gone away, and not each followed his brother.” <verse number="28" style="v" />So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued Israel no more, and they fought no more. <verse number="29" style="v" />Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim. <verse number="30" style="v" />Joab returned from following Abner; and when he had gathered all the people together, nineteen men of David’s and Asahel were missing. <verse number="31" style="v" />But David’s servants had struck Benjamin and of Abner’s men so that three hundred and sixty men died. <verse number="32" style="v" />They took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Bethlehem. Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke on them at Hebron.</para>
  <chapter number="3" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Now there was long war between Saul’s house and David’s house. David grew stronger and stronger, but Saul’s house grew weaker and weaker. <verse number="2" style="v" />Sons were born to David in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; <verse number="3" style="v" />and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; <verse number="4" style="v" />and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; <verse number="5" style="v" />and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" />While there was war between Saul’s house and David’s house, Abner made himself strong in Saul’s house. <verse number="7" style="v" />Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah; and Ishbosheth said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />Then Abner was very angry about Ishbosheth’s words, and said, “Am I a dog’s head that belongs to Judah? Today I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me today with a fault concerning this woman! <verse number="9" style="v" />God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as the LORD has sworn to David, I don’t do even so to him; <verse number="10" style="v" />to transfer the kingdom from Saul’s house, and to set up David’s throne over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.”</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />He said, “Good. I will make a treaty with you, but one thing I require of you. That is, you will not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see my face.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, saying, “Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I was given to marry for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.”</para>

    <verse number="15" style="v" />Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish. <verse number="16" style="v" />Her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go! Return!” and he returned. <verse number="17" style="v" />Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, “In times past, you sought for David to be king over you. <verse number="18" style="v" />Now then do it; for the LORD has spoken of David, saying, ‘By the hand of my servant David, I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.’”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin. <verse number="20" style="v" />So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast. <verse number="21" style="v" />Abner said to David, “I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your soul desires.” David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />Behold, David’s servants and Joab came from a raid, and brought in a great plunder with them; but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace. <verse number="23" style="v" />When Joab and all the army who was with him had come, they told Joab, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he has gone in peace.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="24" style="v" />Then Joab came to the king, and said, “What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you. Why is it that you have sent him away, and he is already gone? <verse number="25" style="v" />You know Abner the son of Ner. He came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="26" style="v" />When Joab had come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David didn’t know it. <verse number="27" style="v" />When Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the middle of the gate to speak with him quietly, and struck him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother. <verse number="28" style="v" />Afterward, when David heard it, he said, “I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner. <verse number="29" style="v" />Let it fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father’s house. Let there not fail from the house of Joab one who has a discharge, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.” <verse number="30" style="v" />So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle. <verse number="31" style="v" />David said to Joab, and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes, and clothe yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn in front of Abner.” King David followed the bier. <verse number="32" style="v" />They buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at Abner’s grave; and all the people wept. <verse number="33" style="v" />The king lamented for Abner, and said, “Should Abner die as a fool dies? <verse number="34" style="v" />Your hands weren’t bound, and your feet weren’t put into fetters. As a man falls before the children of iniquity, so you fell.”</para>
  <para style="p">All the people wept again over him. <verse number="35" style="v" />All the people came to urge David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, “God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything else, until the sun goes down.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="36" style="v" />All the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatever the king did pleased all the people. <verse number="37" style="v" />So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Abner the son of Ner. <verse number="38" style="v" />The king said to his servants, “Don’t you know that a prince and a great man has fallen today in Israel? <verse number="39" style="v" />I am weak today, though anointed king. These men, the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me. May the LORD reward the evildoer according to his wickedness.”</para>
  <chapter number="4" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />When Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled. <verse number="2" style="v" />Saul’s son had two men who were captains of raiding bands. The name of one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is considered a part of Benjamin: <verse number="3" style="v" />and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have lived as foreigners there until today). <verse number="4" style="v" />Now Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the news came about Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse picked him up and fled. As she hurried to flee, he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth. <verse number="5" style="v" />The sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went and came at about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, as he took his rest at noon. <verse number="6" style="v" />They came there into the middle of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they struck him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. <verse number="7" style="v" />Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him, killed him, beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night. <verse number="8" style="v" />They brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, “Behold, the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life! The LORD has avenged my lord the king today of Saul, and of his offspring.<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">4:8 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">or, seed</char></note>”</para>

But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in Abner’s grave in Hebron.</para>

The LORD said to you, ‘You will be shepherd of my people Israel, and you will be prince over Israel.’” <verse number="3" style="v" />So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron, and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel.</para>

This is David’s city. <verse number="8" style="v" />David said on that day, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites, let him go up to the watercourse and strike those lame and blind, who are hated by David’s soul.” Therefore they say, “The blind and the lame can’t come into the house.”</para>

    <verse number="18" style="v" />Hushai said to Absalom, “No; but whomever the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, I will be his, and I will stay with him. <verse number="19" style="v" />Again, whom should I serve? Shouldn’t I serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father’s presence, so I will be in your presence.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your counsel what we shall do.”</para>

    <verse number="21" style="v" />Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to your father’s concubines that he has left to keep the house. Then all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />So they spread a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel. <verse number="23" style="v" />The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man enquired at the inner sanctuary of God. All the counsel of Ahithophel both was like this with David and with Absalom.</para>
  <chapter number="17" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me now choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David tonight. <verse number="2" style="v" />I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted, and will make him afraid. All the people who are with him will flee. I will strike the king only, <verse number="3" style="v" />and I will bring back all the people to you. The man whom you seek is as if all returned. All the people shall be in peace.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />The saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel. <verse number="5" style="v" />Then Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let’s hear likewise what he says.”</para>

    <verse number="7" style="v" />Hushai said to Absalom, “The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.” <verse number="8" style="v" />Hushai said moreover, “You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are fierce in their minds, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people. <verse number="9" style="v" />Behold, he is now hidden in some pit, or in some other place. It will happen, when some of them have fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, ‘There is a slaughter amongst the people who follow Absalom!’ <verse number="10" style="v" />Even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men. <verse number="11" style="v" />But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person. <verse number="12" style="v" />So we will come on him in some place where he will be found, and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground, then we will not leave so much as one of him and of all the men who are with him. <verse number="13" style="v" />Moreover, if he has gone into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there isn’t one small stone found there.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.” For the LORD had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil on Absalom. <verse number="15" style="v" />Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, “Ahithophel counselled Absalom and the elders of Israel that way; and I have counselled this way. <verse number="16" style="v" />Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, ‘Don’t lodge tonight at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.’”</para>

Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. <verse number="25" style="v" />Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />David counted the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them. <verse number="2" style="v" />David sent the people out, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the people, “I will also surely go out with you myself.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" />But the people said, “You shall not go out; for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us out of the city.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />The king said to them, “I will do what seems best to you.”</para>
  <para style="p">The king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands. <verse number="5" style="v" />The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, “Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.” All the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" />So the people went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim. <verse number="7" style="v" />The people of Israel were struck there before David’s servants, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men. <verse number="8" style="v" />For the battle was there spread over the surface of all the country, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured. <verse number="9" style="v" />Absalom happened to meet David’s servants. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the sky and earth; and the mule that was under him went on. <verse number="10" style="v" />A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, “Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.”</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />The man said to Joab, “Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I still wouldn’t stretch out my hand against the king’s son; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, ‘Beware that no one touch the young man Absalom.’ <verse number="13" style="v" />Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hidden from the king), then you yourself would have set yourself against me.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />Then Joab said, “I’m not going to wait like this with you.” He took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the middle of the oak. <verse number="15" style="v" />Ten young men who bore Joab’s armour surrounded and struck Absalom, and killed him. <verse number="16" style="v" />Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held the people back. <verse number="17" style="v" />They took Absalom and cast him into a great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones. Then all Israel fled, each to his own tent. <verse number="18" style="v" />Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar which is in the king’s valley, for he said, “I have no son to keep my name in memory.” He called the pillar after his own name. It is called Absalom’s monument, to this day.</para>

    <verse number="15" style="v" />So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the appointed time; and seventy thousand men died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba. <verse number="16" style="v" />When the angel stretched out his hand towards Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD relented of the disaster, and said to the angel who destroyed the people, “It is enough. Now withdraw your hand.” The LORD’s angel was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</para>

    <verse number="17" style="v" />David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel who struck the people, and said, “Behold, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand be against me, and against my father’s house.”</para>

    <verse number="18" style="v" />Gad came that day to David, and said to him, “Go up, build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”</para>

    <verse number="19" style="v" />David went up according to the saying of Gad, as the LORD commanded. <verse number="20" style="v" />Araunah looked out, and saw the king and his servants coming on towards him. Then Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. <verse number="21" style="v" />Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?”</para>
  <para style="p">David said, “To buy your threshing floor, to build an altar to the LORD, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.”</para>

Behold, the cattle for the burnt offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood. <verse number="23" style="v" />All this, O king, does Araunah give to the king.” Araunah said to the king, “May the LORD your God accept you.”</para>

    <verse number="24" style="v" />The king said to Araunah, “No; but I will most certainly buy it from you for a price.
