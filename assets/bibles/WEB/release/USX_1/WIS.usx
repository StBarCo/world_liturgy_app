    <verse number="6" style="v" />but only the glimmering of a self-kindled fire appeared to them, full of fear.</para>
  <para style="q2">In terror, they considered the things which they saw</para>
  <para style="q2">to be worse than that sight, on which they could not gaze.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />The mockeries of their magic arts were powerless, now,</para>
  <para style="q2">and a shameful rebuke of their boasted understanding:</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />For those who promised to drive away terrors and disorders from a sick soul,</para>
  <para style="q2">these were sick with a ludicrous fearfulness.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />For even if no troubling thing frighted them,</para>
  <para style="q2">yet, scared with the creeping of vermin and hissing of serpents,</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />they perished trembling in fear,</para>
  <para style="q2">refusing even to look at the air, which could not be escaped on any side.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />For wickedness, condemned by a witness within, is a coward thing,</para>
  <para style="q2">and, being pressed hard by conscience, always has added forecasts of the worst.</para>
  <para style="q2">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />For fear is nothing else but a surrender of the help which reason offers;</para>
  <para style="q2">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />and from within, the expectation of being less</para>
  <para style="q2">makes of greater account the ignorance of the cause that brings the torment.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />But they, all through the night which was powerless indeed,</para>

  <para style="q2">sleeping the same sleep,</para>
  <para style="q2">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />now were haunted by monstrous apparitions,</para>
  <para style="q2">and now were paralysed by their soul’s surrendering;</para>

  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="16" style="v" />So then whoever it might be, sinking down in his place,</para>

    <verse number="17" style="v" />for whether he was a farmer, or a shepherd,</para>

  <para style="q2">for they were all bound with one chain of darkness.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="18" style="v" />Whether there was a whistling wind,</para>

  <para style="q2">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />or a harsh crashing of rocks hurled down,</para>

  <para style="q2">or the voice of wild beasts harshly roaring,</para>
  <para style="q2">or an echo rebounding from the hollows of the mountains,</para>
  <para style="q2">all these things paralysed them with terror.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />For the whole world was illuminated with clear light,</para>

    <verse number="21" style="v" />while over them alone was spread a heavy night,</para>
  <para style="q2">an image of the darkness that should afterward receive them;</para>

  <chapter number="18" style="c" />
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />But for your holy ones there was great light.</para>
  <para style="q2">Their enemies, hearing their voice but seeing not their form,</para>

  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="2" style="v" />yet for that they do not hurt them, though wronged by them before, they are thankful;</para>
  <para style="q2">and because they had been at variance with them, they begged for pardon.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="3" style="v" />Whereas you provided a burning pillar of fire,</para>

  <para style="q1">

  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />After they had taken counsel to kill the babes of the holy ones,</para>

  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="6" style="v" />Our fathers were made aware of that night beforehand,</para>

  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />Salvation of the righteous and destruction of the enemies was expected by your people.</para>
  <para style="q1">

  <para style="q2">by the same means, calling us to yourself, you glorified us.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />For holy children of good men offered sacrifice in secret,</para>

  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />But the discordant cry of the enemies echoed back,</para>

  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />Both servant and master were punished with the same just doom,</para>
  <para style="q2">and the commoner suffering the same as king;</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />Yes, they all together, under one form of death,</para>

  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />For while they were disbelieving all things by reason of the enchantments,</para>
  <para style="q2">upon the destruction of the firstborn they confessed the people to be God’s son.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />For while peaceful silence wrapped all things,</para>

  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />your all-powerful word leapt from heaven out of the royal thrones,</para>

    <verse number="16" style="v" />bearing as a sharp sword your authentic commandment,</para>

  <para style="q2">and while it touched the heaven it stood upon the earth.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="17" style="v" />Then immediately apparitions in dreams terribly troubled them,</para>

  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="18" style="v" />And each, one thrown here half dead, another there,</para>

    <verse number="21" style="v" />For a blameless man hurried to be their champion,</para>

  <para style="q2">showing that he was your servant.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />And he overcame the anger,</para>
  <para style="q2">not by strength of body, not by force of weapons,</para>
  <para style="q2">but he subdued him who was punishing by word,</para>
  <para style="q2">by bringing to remembrance oaths and covenants made with the fathers.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="23" style="v" />For when the dead had already fallen in heaps one upon another,</para>

  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="24" style="v" />For the whole world was upon his long robe,</para>

  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="25" style="v" />The destroyer yielded to these, and they feared;</para>

  <para style="b" />
  <chapter number="19" style="c" />
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />But indignation without mercy came upon the ungodly to the end;</para>
  <para style="q2">For God also foreknew their future,</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="2" style="v" />how, having changed their minds to let your people go,</para>
  <para style="q2">and having sped them eagerly on their way,</para>
  <para style="q2">they would change their minds and pursue them.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="3" style="v" />For while they were yet in the midst of their mourning,</para>
  <para style="q2">and lamenting at the graves of the dead,</para>
  <para style="q2">they drew upon themselves another counsel of folly,</para>
  <para style="q2">and pursued as fugitives those whom they had begged to leave and driven out.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />For the doom which they deserved was drawing them to this end,</para>
  <para style="q2">and it made them forget the things that had happened to them,</para>
  <para style="q2">that they might fill up the punishment which was yet lacking to their torments,</para>
  <para style="q2">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />and that your people might journey on by a marvellous road,</para>
  <para style="q2">but they themselves might find a strange death.</para>
  <para style="b" />
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="6" style="v" />For the whole creation, each part in its diverse kind, was made new again,</para>
  <para style="q2">complying with your commandments,</para>
  <para style="q2">that your servants might be kept unharmed.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />Then the cloud that overshadowed the camp was seen,</para>
  <para style="q2">and dry land rising up out of what had been water,</para>
  <para style="q2">out of the Red sea an unhindered highway,</para>
  <para style="q2">and a grassy plain out of the violent surge,</para>
  <para style="q2">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />by which they passed over with all their army,</para>
  <para style="q2">these who were covered with your hand,</para>
  <para style="q2">having seen strange marvels.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />For like horses they roamed at large,</para>
  <para style="q2">and they skipped about like lambs,</para>
  <para style="q2">praising you, O Lord, who was their deliverer.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />For they still remembered the things that happened in the time of their sojourning,</para>
  <para style="q2">how instead of bearing cattle, the land brought forth lice,</para>
  <para style="q2">and instead of fish, the river spewed out a multitude of frogs.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />But afterwards, they also saw a new kind of birds,</para>
  <para style="q2">when, led on by desire, they asked for luxurious dainties;</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />For, to comfort them, quails came up for them from the sea.</para>
  <para style="b" />
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />Punishments came upon the sinners,</para>
  <para style="q2">not without the signs that were given beforehand by the force of the thunders;</para>
  <para style="q2">for they justly suffered through their own wickednesses,</para>
  <para style="q2">for the hatred which they practised towards guests was grievous indeed.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />For whereas the others didn’t receive the strangers when they came to them,</para>
  <para style="q2">the Egyptians made slaves of guests who were their benefactors.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />And not only so, but God will visit the men of Sodom another way,</para>
  <para style="q2">since they received as enemies those who were aliens;</para>
  <para style="q2">
    <verse number="16" style="v" />whereas these first welcomed with feastings,</para>
  <para style="q2">and then afflicted with dreadful toils,</para>
  <para style="q2">those who had already shared with them in the same rights.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="17" style="v" />And moreover they were stricken with loss of sight</para>
  <para style="q2">(even as were those others at the righteous man’s doors),</para>
  <para style="q2">when, being surrounded with yawning darkness,</para>
  <para style="q2">they each looked for the passage through his own door.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="18" style="v" />For as the notes of a lute vary the character of the rhythm,</para>
  <para style="q2">even so the elements, changing their order one with another,</para>
  <para style="q2">continuing always in its sound,</para>
  <para style="q2">as may clearly be conjectured from the sight of the things that have happened.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />For creatures of the dry land were turned into creatures of the waters,</para>
  <para style="q2">and creatures that swim moved upon the land.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />Fire kept the mastery of its own power in water,</para>
  <para style="q2">and water forgot its quenching nature.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="21" style="v" />On the contrary, flames didn’t consume flesh of perishable creatures that walked amongst them,</para>
  <para style="q2">neither did they melt the ice-like grains of ambrosial food that were apt to melt.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />For in all things, O Lord, you magnified your people,</para>
  <para style="q2">and you glorified them and didn’t lightly regard them,</para>
  <para style="q2">standing by their side in every time and place.</para>
