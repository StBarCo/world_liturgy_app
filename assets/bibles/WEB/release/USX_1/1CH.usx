As for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the LORD’s covenant, and for the footstool of our God; and I had prepared for the building. <verse number="3" style="v" />But God said to me, ‘You shall not build a house for my name, because you are a man of war, and have shed blood.’ <verse number="4" style="v" />However the LORD, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever. For he has chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father; and amongst the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel. <verse number="5" style="v" />Of all my sons (for the LORD has given me many sons), he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the LORD’s kingdom over Israel. <verse number="6" style="v" />He said to me, ‘Solomon, your son, shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. <verse number="7" style="v" />I will establish his kingdom forever if he continues to do my commandments and my ordinances, as it is today.’</para>

If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever. <verse number="10" style="v" />Take heed now; for the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary.
