    <verse number="1" style="v" />Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob): <verse number="2" style="v" />Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, <verse number="3" style="v" />Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, <verse number="4" style="v" />Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. <verse number="5" style="v" />All the souls who came out of Jacob’s body were seventy souls, and Joseph was in Egypt already. <verse number="6" style="v" />Joseph died, as did all his brothers, and all that generation. <verse number="7" style="v" />The children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who didn’t know Joseph. <verse number="9" style="v" />He said to his people, “Behold,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:9 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">“Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.

They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses. <verse number="12" style="v" />But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. They started to dread the children of Israel. <verse number="13" style="v" />The Egyptians ruthlessly made the children of Israel serve, <verse number="14" style="v" />and they made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and in brick, and in all kinds of service in the field, all their service, in which they ruthlessly made them serve.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah, <verse number="16" style="v" />and he said, “When you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birth stool, if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live.” <verse number="17" style="v" />But the midwives feared God,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:17 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</char></note> and didn’t do what the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the baby boys alive. <verse number="18" style="v" />The king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, “Why have you done this thing and saved the boys alive?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women aren’t like the Egyptian women; for they are vigourous and give birth before the midwife comes to them.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty. <verse number="21" style="v" />Because the midwives feared God, he gave them families. <verse number="22" style="v" />Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, “You shall cast every son who is born into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.”</para>
  <chapter number="2" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />A man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi as his wife. <verse number="2" style="v" />The woman conceived and bore a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months. <verse number="3" style="v" />When she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him, and coated it with tar and with pitch. She put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river’s bank. <verse number="4" style="v" />His sister stood far off, to see what would be done to him. <verse number="5" style="v" />Pharaoh’s daughter came down to bathe at the river. Her maidens walked along by the riverside. She saw the basket amongst the reeds, and sent her servant to get it. <verse number="6" style="v" />She opened it, and saw the child, and behold, the baby cried. She had compassion on him, and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?”</para>

    <verse number="8" style="v" />Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.”</para>
  <para style="p">The young woman went and called the child’s mother. <verse number="9" style="v" />Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.”</para>
  <para style="p">The woman took the child, and nursed it. <verse number="10" style="v" />The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">2:10 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">“Moses” sounds like the Hebrew for “draw out”.</char></note> and said, “Because I drew him out of the water.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />In those days, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his brothers and saw their burdens. He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers. <verse number="12" style="v" />He looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one, he killed the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />He went out the second day, and behold, two men of the Hebrews were fighting with each other. He said to him who did the wrong, “Why do you strike your fellow?”</para>

    <verse number="14" style="v" />He said, “Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you plan to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?”</para>
  <para style="p">Moses was afraid, and said, “Surely this thing is known.” <verse number="15" style="v" />Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and lived in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="16" style="v" />Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock. <verse number="17" style="v" />The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. <verse number="18" style="v" />When they came to Reuel, their father, he said, “How is it that you have returned so early today?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />They said, “An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.”</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" />Moses was content to dwell with the man. He gave Moses Zipporah, his daughter. <verse number="22" style="v" />She bore a son, and he named him Gershom,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">2:22 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">“Gershom” sounds like the Hebrew for “an alien there”.</char></note> for he said, “I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" />In the course of those many days, the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the bondage. <verse number="24" style="v" />God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. <verse number="25" style="v" />God saw the children of Israel, and God was concerned about them.</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to God’s mountain, to Horeb. <verse number="2" style="v" />The LORD’s<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">3:2 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">When rendered in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, “LORD” or “GOD” is the translation of God’s Proper Name.</char></note> angel appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the middle of a bush.
