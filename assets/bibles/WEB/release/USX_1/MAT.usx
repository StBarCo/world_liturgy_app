    <verse number="1" style="v" />Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. <verse number="2" style="v" />Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky and came and rolled away the stone from the door and sat on it. <verse number="3" style="v" />His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. <verse number="4" style="v" />For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men. <verse number="5" style="v" />The angel answered the women, “Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified. <verse number="6" style="v" />He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying. <verse number="7" style="v" />Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.”</para>

    <verse number="8" style="v" />They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word. <verse number="9" style="v" />As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, <char style="wj">“Rejoice!”</char></para>

    <verse number="11" style="v" />Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city and told the chief priests all the things that had happened. <verse number="12" style="v" />When they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers, <verse number="13" style="v" />saying, “Say that his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept. <verse number="14" style="v" />If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.” <verse number="15" style="v" />So they took the money and did as they were told.
