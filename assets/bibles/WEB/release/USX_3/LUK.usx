    <verse number="1" style="v" />Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled amongst us, <verse number="2" style="v" />even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us, <verse number="3" style="v" />it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus; <verse number="4" style="v" />that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. <verse number="6" style="v" />They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. <verse number="7" style="v" />But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />Now while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his division <verse number="9" style="v" />according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. <verse number="10" style="v" />The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense. <verse number="12" style="v" />Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. <verse number="13" style="v" />But the angel said to him, “Don’t be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard. Your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. <verse number="14" style="v" />You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth. <verse number="15" style="v" />For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb. <verse number="16" style="v" />He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God. <verse number="17" style="v" />He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, ‘to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,’<note caller="+" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">1:17 </char><char style="xt" closed="false"><ref loc="MAL 4:6">Malachi 4:6</ref></char></note> and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a people prepared for the Lord.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="18" style="v" />Zacharias said to the angel, “How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. <verse number="20" style="v" />Behold,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:20 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">“Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" />The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marvelled that he delayed in the temple. <verse number="22" style="v" />When he came out, he could not speak to them. They perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute. <verse number="23" style="v" />When the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house. <verse number="24" style="v" />After these days Elizabeth his wife conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying, <verse number="25" style="v" />“Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach amongst men.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="26" style="v" />Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, <verse number="27" style="v" />to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of David’s house. The virgin’s name was Mary. <verse number="28" style="v" />Having come in, the angel said to her, “Rejoice, you highly favoured one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you amongst women!”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="29" style="v" />But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be. <verse number="30" style="v" />The angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. <verse number="31" style="v" />Behold, you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son, and shall name him ‘Jesus.’ <verse number="32" style="v" />He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, <verse number="33" style="v" />and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="34" style="v" />Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="35" style="v" />The angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called the Son of God. <verse number="36" style="v" />Behold, Elizabeth your relative also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. <verse number="37" style="v" />For nothing spoken by God is impossible.”<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:37 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">or, “For everything spoken by God is possible.”</char></note></para>

  <para style="p">Then the angel departed from her.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="39" style="v" />Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah, <verse number="40" style="v" />and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. <verse number="41" style="v" />When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leapt in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. <verse number="42" style="v" />She called out with a loud voice and said, “Blessed are you amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! <verse number="43" style="v" />Why am I so favoured, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? <verse number="44" style="v" />For behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leapt in my womb for joy! <verse number="45" style="v" />Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfilment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!”</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />Now in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled. <verse number="2" style="v" />This was the first enrolment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria. <verse number="3" style="v" />All went to enrol themselves, everyone to his own city. <verse number="4" style="v" />Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David; <verse number="5" style="v" />to enrol himself with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant.</para>
