    <verse number="8" style="v" />Solomon said to God, “You have shown great loving kindness to David my father, and have made me king in his place. <verse number="9" style="v" />Now, LORD God, let your promise to David my father be established; for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude. <verse number="10" style="v" />Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this great people of yours?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />God said to Solomon, “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, honour, or the life of those who hate you, nor yet have you asked for long life; but have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you king, <verse number="12" style="v" />therefore wisdom and knowledge is granted to you. I will give you riches, wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had who have been before you, and none after you will have.”</para>
