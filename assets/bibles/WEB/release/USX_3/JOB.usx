  <chapter number="1" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:1 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</char></note> and turned away from evil. <verse number="2" style="v" />There were born to him seven sons and three daughters. <verse number="3" style="v" />His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east. <verse number="4" style="v" />His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. <verse number="5" style="v" />It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts.” Job did so continually.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" />Now on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before the LORD,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:6 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">When rendered in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, “LORD” or “GOD” is the translation of God’s Proper Name.</char></note> Satan also came amongst them. <verse number="7" style="v" />The LORD said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”</para>
  <para style="p">Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />The LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant, Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing? <verse number="10" style="v" />Haven’t you made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. <verse number="11" style="v" />But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />The LORD said to Satan, “Behold,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:12 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">“Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</char></note> all that he has is in your power. Only on himself don’t stretch out your hand.”</para>
  <para style="p">So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD. <verse number="13" style="v" />It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, <verse number="14" style="v" />that a messenger came to Job, and said, “The oxen were ploughing, and the donkeys feeding beside them, <verse number="15" style="v" />and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="16" style="v" />While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of God has fallen from the sky, and has burnt up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" />While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="18" style="v" />While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, <verse number="19" style="v" />and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshipped. <verse number="21" style="v" />He said, “Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked will I return there. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away. Blessed be the LORD’s name.” <verse number="22" style="v" />In all this, Job didn’t sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing.</para>
  <chapter number="2" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Again, on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before the LORD, Satan came also amongst them to present himself before the LORD. <verse number="2" style="v" />The LORD said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”</para>
  <para style="p">Satan answered the LORD, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" />The LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin him without cause.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />Satan answered the LORD, and said, “Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life. <verse number="5" style="v" />But stretch out your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" />The LORD said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD, and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head. <verse number="8" style="v" />He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat amongst the ashes. <verse number="9" style="v" />Then his wife said to him, “Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?”</para>
  <para style="p">In all this Job didn’t sin with his lips. <verse number="11" style="v" />Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathise with him and to comfort him. <verse number="12" style="v" />When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn’t recognise him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads towards the sky. <verse number="13" style="v" />So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.</para>
  <chapter number="3" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth. <verse number="2" style="v" />Job answered:</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />Then Job answered the LORD,</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="2" style="v" />“I know that you can do all things,</para>
  <para style="q2">and that no purpose of yours can be restrained.</para>
  <para style="q1">
    <verse number="3" style="v" />You asked, ‘Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?’</para>
  <para style="q2">therefore I have uttered that which I didn’t understand,</para>
  <para style="q2">things too wonderful for me, which I didn’t know.</para>

  <para style="q2">and repent in dust and ashes.”</para>
  <para style="b" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />It was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has. <verse number="8" style="v" />Now therefore, take to yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept him, that I not deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did what the LORD commanded them, and the LORD accepted Job.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />The LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends. The LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. <verse number="11" style="v" />Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, came to him and ate bread with him in his house. They comforted him, and consoled him concerning all the evil that the LORD had brought on him. Everyone also gave him a piece of money,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">42:11 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">literally, kesitah, a unit of money, probably silver</char></note> and everyone a ring of gold.</para>

    <verse number="12" style="v" />So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys. <verse number="13" style="v" />He had also seven sons and three daughters. <verse number="14" style="v" />He called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren Happuch. <verse number="15" style="v" />In all the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job. Their father gave them an inheritance amongst their brothers. <verse number="16" style="v" />After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, to four generations. <verse number="17" style="v" />So Job died, being old and full of days.</para>
