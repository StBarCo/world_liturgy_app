    <verse number="12" style="v" />Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, saying, <verse number="13" style="v" />“Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, ‘The LORD your God gives you rest, and will give you this land. <verse number="14" style="v" />Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall live in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but you shall pass over before your brothers armed, all the mighty men of valour, and shall help them <verse number="15" style="v" />until the LORD has given your brothers rest, as he has given you, and they have also possessed the land which the LORD your God gives them.

    <verse number="1" style="v" />Joshua the son of Nun secretly sent two men out of Shittim as spies, saying, “Go, view the land, including Jericho.” They went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab, and slept there.</para>

Where the men went, I don’t know. Pursue them quickly.

Then the people passed over near Jericho. <verse number="17" style="v" />The priests who bore the ark of the LORD’s covenant stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan; and all Israel crossed over on dry ground, until all the nation had passed completely over the Jordan.</para>
  <chapter number="4" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />When all the nation had completely crossed over the Jordan, the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying, <verse number="2" style="v" />“Take twelve men out of the people, a man out of every tribe, <verse number="3" style="v" />and command them, saying, ‘Take from out of the middle of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve stones, carry them over with you, and lay them down in the place where you’ll camp tonight.’”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, a man out of every tribe. <verse number="5" style="v" />Joshua said to them, “Cross before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you pick up a stone and put it on your shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; <verse number="6" style="v" />that this may be a sign amongst you, that when your children ask in the future, saying, ‘What do you mean by these stones?’ <verse number="7" style="v" />then you shall tell them, ‘Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the LORD’s covenant. When it crossed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel forever.’”</para>

    <verse number="8" style="v" />The children of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as the LORD spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />The children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spoke to them. <verse number="13" style="v" />About forty thousand men, ready and armed for war, passed over before the LORD to battle, to the plains of Jericho. <verse number="14" style="v" />On that day, the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.</para>

    <verse number="17" style="v" />Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, “Come up out of the Jordan!” <verse number="18" style="v" />When the priests who bore the ark of the LORD’s covenant had come up out of the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet had been lifted up to the dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and went over all its banks, as before. <verse number="19" style="v" />The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />Joshua set up those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, in Gilgal. <verse number="21" style="v" />He spoke to the children of Israel, saying, “When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, ‘What do these stones mean?’ <verse number="22" style="v" />Then you shall let your children know, saying, ‘Israel came over this Jordan on dry land. <verse number="23" style="v" />For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you until you had crossed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we had crossed over, <verse number="24" style="v" />that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD’s hand is mighty, and that you may fear the LORD your God forever.’”</para>
  <chapter number="5" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />When all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard how the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel until we had crossed over, their heart melted, and there was no more spirit in them, because of the children of Israel. <verse number="2" style="v" />At that time, the LORD said to Joshua, “Make flint knives, and circumcise again the sons of Israel the second time.” <verse number="3" style="v" />Joshua made himself flint knives, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins. <verse number="4" style="v" />This is the reason Joshua circumcised them: all the people who came out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness along the way, after they came out of Egypt. <verse number="5" style="v" />For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all the people who were born in the wilderness along the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised. <verse number="6" style="v" />For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness until all the nation, even the men of war who came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they didn’t listen to the LORD’s voice. The LORD swore to them that he wouldn’t let them see the land which the LORD swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. <verse number="7" style="v" />Their children, whom he raised up in their place, were circumcised by Joshua, for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way. <verse number="8" style="v" />When they were done circumcising the whole nation, they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />The LORD said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” Therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">5:9 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">“Gilgal” sounds like the Hebrew for “roll.”</char></note> to this day. <verse number="10" style="v" />The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal. They kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho. <verse number="11" style="v" />They ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover, in the same day. <verse number="12" style="v" />The manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce of the land. The children of Israel didn’t have manna any more, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</para>

    <verse number="13" style="v" />When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for us, or for our enemies?”</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the children of Israel. No one went out, and no one came in. <verse number="2" style="v" />The LORD said to Joshua, “Behold, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king and the mighty men of valour. <verse number="3" style="v" />All of your men of war shall march around the city, going around the city once. You shall do this six days. <verse number="4" style="v" />Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark. On the seventh day, you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets. <verse number="5" style="v" />It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; then the city wall will fall down flat, and the people shall go up, every man straight in front of him.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" />Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the LORD’s ark.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />They said to the people, “Advance! March around the city, and let the armed men pass on before the LORD’s ark.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />It was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the LORD advanced and blew the trumpets, and the ark of the LORD’s covenant followed them. <verse number="9" style="v" />The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the ark went after them. The trumpets sounded as they went.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />Joshua commanded the people, saying, “You shall not shout nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout.” <verse number="11" style="v" />So he caused the LORD’s ark to go around the city, circling it once. Then they came into the camp, and stayed in the camp. <verse number="12" style="v" />Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the LORD’s ark. <verse number="13" style="v" />The seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns in front of the LORD’s ark went on continually, and blew the trumpets. The armed men went in front of them. The rear guard came after the LORD’s ark. The trumpets sounded as they went. <verse number="14" style="v" />The second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. They did this six days.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />On the seventh day, they rose early at the dawning of the day, and marched around the city in the same way seven times. On this day only they marched around the city seven times. <verse number="16" style="v" />At the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, “Shout, for the LORD has given you the city! <verse number="17" style="v" />The city shall be devoted, even it and all that is in it, to the LORD. Only Rahab the prostitute shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent. <verse number="18" style="v" />But as for you, only keep yourselves from what is devoted to destruction, lest when you have devoted it, you take of the devoted thing; so you would make the camp of Israel accursed and trouble it. <verse number="19" style="v" />But all the silver, gold, and vessels of bronze and iron are holy to the LORD. They shall come into the LORD’s treasury.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />So the people shouted and the priests blew the trumpets. When the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight in front of him, and they took the city. <verse number="21" style="v" />They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword. <verse number="22" style="v" />Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the prostitute’s house, and bring the woman and all that she has out from there, as you swore to her.” <verse number="23" style="v" />The young men who were spies went in, and brought out Rahab with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had. They also brought out all of her relatives, and they set them outside of the camp of Israel. <verse number="24" style="v" />They burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only they put the silver, the gold, and the vessels of bronze and of iron into the treasury of the LORD’s house. <verse number="25" style="v" />But Rahab the prostitute, her father’s household, and all that she had, Joshua saved alive. She lives in the middle of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="26" style="v" />Joshua commanded them with an oath at that time, saying, “Cursed is the man before the LORD who rises up and builds this city Jericho. With the loss of his firstborn he will lay its foundation, and with the loss of his youngest son he will set up its gates.” <verse number="27" style="v" />So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.</para>
  <chapter number="7" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted things; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things. Therefore the LORD’s anger burnt against the children of Israel. <verse number="2" style="v" />Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, “Go up and spy out the land.”</para>
  <para style="p">The men went up and spied out Ai. <verse number="3" style="v" />They returned to Joshua, and said to him, “Don’t let all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai. Don’t make all the people to toil there, for there are only a few of them.” <verse number="4" style="v" />So about three thousand men of the people went up there, and they fled before the men of Ai. <verse number="5" style="v" />The men of Ai struck about thirty-six men of them. They chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and struck them at the descent. The hearts of the people melted, and became like water. <verse number="6" style="v" />Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the LORD’s ark until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads. <verse number="7" style="v" />Joshua said, “Alas, Lord GOD, why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? I wish that we had been content and lived beyond the Jordan! <verse number="8" style="v" />Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after Israel has turned their backs before their enemies? <verse number="9" style="v" />For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. What will you do for your great name?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />The LORD said to Joshua, “Get up! Why have you fallen on your face like that? <verse number="11" style="v" />Israel has sinned. Yes, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them. Yes, they have even taken some of the devoted things, and have also stolen, and also deceived. They have even put it amongst their own stuff. <verse number="12" style="v" />Therefore the children of Israel can’t stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become devoted for destruction.

The LORD will trouble you today.” All Israel stoned him with stones, and they burnt them with fire and stoned them with stones. <verse number="26" style="v" />They raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day.
