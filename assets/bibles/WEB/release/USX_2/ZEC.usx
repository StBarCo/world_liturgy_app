  <para style="p">“Then they repented and said, ‘Just as the LORD of Armies determined to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our practices, so he has dealt with us.’” <verse number="7" style="v" />On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the LORD’s word came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying, <verse number="8" style="v" />“I had a vision in the night, and behold,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:8 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">“Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />Then the LORD’s angel replied, “O LORD of Armies, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these seventy years?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />The LORD answered the angel who talked with me with kind and comforting words. <verse number="14" style="v" />So the angel who talked with me said to me, “Proclaim, saying, ‘The LORD of Armies says: “I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy. <verse number="15" style="v" />I am very angry with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, but they added to the calamity.” <verse number="16" style="v" />Therefore the LORD says: “I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="18" style="v" />I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, four horns. <verse number="19" style="v" />I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these?”</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />The LORD showed me four craftsmen. <verse number="21" style="v" />Then I asked, “What are these coming to do?”</para>

  <chapter number="2" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand. <verse number="2" style="v" />Then I asked, “Where are you going?”</para>

    <verse number="3" style="v" />Behold, the angel who talked with me went out, and another angel went out to meet him, <verse number="4" style="v" />and said to him, “Run, speak to this young man, saying, ‘Jerusalem will be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of men and livestock in it. <verse number="5" style="v" />For I,’ says the LORD, ‘will be to her a wall of fire around it, and I will be the glory in the middle of her. <verse number="6" style="v" />Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,’ says the LORD; ‘for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the sky,’ says the LORD. <verse number="7" style="v" />‘Come, Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.’ <verse number="8" style="v" />For the LORD of Armies says: ‘For honour he has sent me to the nations which plundered you; for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye. <verse number="9" style="v" />For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they will be a plunder to those who served them; and you will know that the LORD of Armies has sent me. <verse number="10" style="v" />Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion; for, behold, I come, and I will dwell within you,’ says the LORD. <verse number="11" style="v" />Many nations shall join themselves to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell amongst you, and you shall know that the LORD of Armies has sent me to you. <verse number="12" style="v" />The LORD will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. <verse number="13" style="v" />Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for he has roused himself from his holy habitation!”</para>
  <chapter number="3" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the LORD’s angel, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary. <verse number="2" style="v" />The LORD said to Satan, “The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Yes, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Isn’t this a burning stick plucked out of the fire?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" />Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel. <verse number="4" style="v" />He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, “Take the filthy garments off him.” To him he said, “Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with rich clothing.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />I said, “Let them set a clean turban on his head.”</para>
  <para style="p">So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him; and the LORD’s angel was standing by. <verse number="6" style="v" />The LORD’s angel protested to Joshua, saying, <verse number="7" style="v" />“The LORD of Armies says: ‘If you will walk in my ways, and if you will follow my instructions, then you also shall judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you a place of access amongst these who stand by. <verse number="8" style="v" />Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you; for they are men who are a sign: for, behold, I will bring out my servant, the Branch. <verse number="9" style="v" />For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave its engraving,’ says the LORD of Armies, ‘and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. <verse number="10" style="v" />In that day,’ says the LORD of Armies, ‘you will invite every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.’”</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />The angel who talked with me came again, and wakened me, as a man who is wakened out of his sleep. <verse number="2" style="v" />He said to me, “What do you see?”</para>
  <para style="p">I said, “I have seen, and behold, a lamp stand all of gold, with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it; there are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are on the top of it; <verse number="3" style="v" />and two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on the left side of it.”</para>

    <verse number="6" style="v" />Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, “This is the LORD’s word to Zerubbabel, saying, ‘Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says the LORD of Armies. <verse number="7" style="v" />Who are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you are a plain; and he will bring out the capstone with shouts of ‘Grace, grace, to it!’”</para>

    <verse number="8" style="v" />Moreover the LORD’s word came to me, saying, <verse number="9" style="v" />“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands shall also finish it; and you will know that the LORD of Armies has sent me to you. <verse number="10" style="v" />Indeed, who despises the day of small things?

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />Then I asked him, “What are these two olive trees on the right side of the lamp stand and on the left side of it?”</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" />Then he said to me, “This is the curse that goes out over the surface of the whole land; for everyone who steals shall be cut off according to it on the one side; and everyone who swears falsely shall be cut off according to it on the other side. <verse number="4" style="v" />I will cause it to go out,” says the LORD of Armies, “and it will enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him who swears falsely by my name; and it will remain in the middle of his house, and will destroy it with its timber and its stones.”</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />In the fourth year of king Darius, the LORD’s word came to Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, the month of Chislev. <verse number="2" style="v" />The people of Bethel sent Sharezer and Regem Melech, and their men, to entreat the LORD’s favour, <verse number="3" style="v" />and to speak to the priests of the house of the LORD of Armies, and to the prophets, saying, “Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?”</para>

Therefore great wrath came from the LORD of Armies. <verse number="13" style="v" />It has come to pass that, as he called, and they refused to listen, so they will call, and I will not listen,” said the LORD of Armies; <verse number="14" style="v" />“but I will scatter them with a whirlwind amongst all the nations which they have not known.
