    <verse number="1" style="v" />Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen ones who are living as foreigners in the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, <verse number="2" style="v" />according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, that you may obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" />Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, <verse number="4" style="v" />to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that doesn’t fade away, reserved in Heaven for you, <verse number="5" style="v" />who by the power of God are guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. <verse number="6" style="v" />Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved in various trials, <verse number="7" style="v" />that the proof of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes even though it is tested by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honour at the revelation of Jesus Christ— <verse number="8" style="v" />whom, not having known, you love. In him, though now you don’t see him, yet believing, you rejoice greatly with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory, <verse number="9" style="v" />receiving the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls. <verse number="10" style="v" />Concerning this salvation, the prophets sought and searched diligently. They prophesied of the grace that would come to you, <verse number="11" style="v" />searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ, which was in them, pointed to, when he predicted the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that would follow them. <verse number="12" style="v" />To them it was revealed, that they served not themselves, but you, in these things, which now have been announced to you through those who preached the Good News to you by the Holy Spirit sent out from heaven; which things angels desire to look into.</para>

    <verse number="13" style="v" />Now who will harm you if you become imitators of that which is good? <verse number="14" style="v" />But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you are blessed. “Don’t fear what they fear, neither be troubled.”<note caller="+" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">3:14 </char><char style="xt" closed="false"><ref loc="ISA 8:12">Isaiah 8:12</ref></char></note> <verse number="15" style="v" />But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts. Always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, with humility and fear, <verse number="16" style="v" />having a good conscience. Thus, while you are spoken against as evildoers, they may be disappointed who curse your good way of life in Christ. <verse number="17" style="v" />For it is better, if it is God’s will, that you suffer for doing well than for doing evil. <verse number="18" style="v" />Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit, <verse number="19" style="v" />in whom he also went and preached to the spirits in prison, <verse number="20" style="v" />who before were disobedient, when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, while the ship was being built. In it, few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water. <verse number="21" style="v" />This is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you—not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, <verse number="22" style="v" />who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />Therefore, since Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, <verse number="2" style="v" />that you no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God. <verse number="3" style="v" />For we have spent enough of our past time doing the desire of the Gentiles, and having walked in lewdness, lusts, drunken binges, orgies, carousings, and abominable idolatries. <verse number="4" style="v" />They think it is strange that you don’t run with them into the same excess of riot, blaspheming. <verse number="5" style="v" />They will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. <verse number="6" style="v" />For to this end the Good News was preached even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh, but live as to God in the spirit.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />But the end of all things is near. Therefore be of sound mind, self-controlled, and sober in prayer. <verse number="8" style="v" />And above all things be earnest in your love amongst yourselves, for love covers a multitude of sins. <verse number="9" style="v" />Be hospitable to one another without grumbling. <verse number="10" style="v" />As each has received a gift, employ it in serving one another, as good managers of the grace of God in its various forms. <verse number="11" style="v" />If anyone speaks, let it be as it were the very words of God. If anyone serves, let it be as of the strength which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever.

    <verse number="12" style="v" />Beloved, don’t be astonished at the fiery trial which has come upon you to test you, as though a strange thing happened to you. <verse number="13" style="v" />But because you are partakers of Christ’s sufferings, rejoice, that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with exceeding joy. <verse number="14" style="v" />If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. On their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified. <verse number="15" style="v" />For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil doer, or a meddler in other men’s matters. <verse number="16" style="v" />But if one of you suffers for being a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this matter. <verse number="17" style="v" />For the time has come for judgement to begin with the household of God. If it begins first with us, what will happen to those who don’t obey the Good News of God? <verse number="18" style="v" />“If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will happen to the ungodly and the sinner?”<note caller="+" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">4:18 </char><char style="xt" closed="false"><ref loc="PRO 11:31">Proverbs 11:31</ref></char></note> <verse number="19" style="v" />Therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to him, as to a faithful Creator.</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />Therefore I exhort the elders amongst you, as a fellow elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed: <verse number="2" style="v" />Shepherd the flock of God which is amongst you, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily, not for dishonest gain, but willingly; <verse number="3" style="v" />not as lording it over those entrusted to you, but making yourselves examples to the flock. <verse number="4" style="v" />When the chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that doesn’t fade away.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder.
