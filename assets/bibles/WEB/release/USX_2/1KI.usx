    <verse number="1" style="v" />Now king David was old and advanced in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he couldn’t keep warm. <verse number="2" style="v" />Therefore his servants said to him, “Let a young virgin be sought for my lord the king. Let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may keep warm.” <verse number="3" style="v" />So they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. <verse number="4" style="v" />The young lady was very beautiful; and she cherished the king, and served him; but the king didn’t know her intimately.</para>

    <verse number="5" style="v" />Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I will be king.” Then he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. <verse number="6" style="v" />His father had not displeased him at any time in saying, “Why have you done so?” and he was also a very handsome man; and he was born after Absalom. <verse number="7" style="v" />He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest; and they followed Adonijah and helped him. <verse number="8" style="v" />But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah. <verse number="9" style="v" />Adonijah killed sheep, cattle, and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel; and he called all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s servants; <verse number="10" style="v" />but he didn’t call Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother. <verse number="11" style="v" />Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, “Haven’t you heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and David our lord doesn’t know it? <verse number="12" style="v" />Now therefore come, please let me give you counsel, that you may save your own life, and your son Solomon’s life. <verse number="13" style="v" />Go in to king David, and tell him, ‘Didn’t you, my lord, king, swear to your servant, saying, “Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?” Why then does Adonijah reign?’ <verse number="14" style="v" />Behold,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:14 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">“Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />Behold, while she was still talking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. <verse number="23" style="v" />They told the king, saying, “Behold, Nathan the prophet!”</para>
  <para style="p">When he had come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. <verse number="24" style="v" />Nathan said, “My lord, king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?’ <verse number="25" style="v" />For he has gone down today, and has slain cattle, fatlings, and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king’s sons, the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest. Behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and saying, ‘Long live king Adonijah!’ <verse number="26" style="v" />But he hasn’t called me, even me your servant, Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon. <verse number="27" style="v" />Was this thing done by my lord the king, and you haven’t shown to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="28" style="v" />Then king David answered, “Call Bathsheba in to me.” She came into the king’s presence and stood before the king. <verse number="29" style="v" />The king swore, and said, “As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity, <verse number="30" style="v" />most certainly as I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel, saying, ‘Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place;’ I will most certainly do this today.”</para>

Blow the trumpet, and say, ‘Long live king Solomon!’ <verse number="35" style="v" />Then come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne; for he shall be king in my place. I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="36" style="v" />Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, “Amen.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="38" style="v" />So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon. <verse number="39" style="v" />Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the Tent, and anointed Solomon.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="40" style="v" />All the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with their sound. <verse number="41" style="v" />Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had finished eating. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, “Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="42" style="v" />While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said, “Come in; for you are a worthy man, and bring good news.”</para>

They have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that you have heard. <verse number="46" style="v" />Also, Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom. <verse number="47" style="v" />Moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, ‘May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne;’ and the king bowed himself on the bed. <verse number="48" style="v" />Also thus said the king, ‘Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne today, my eyes even seeing it.’”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="49" style="v" />All the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and each man went his way. <verse number="50" style="v" />Adonijah was afraid because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and hung onto the horns of the altar. <verse number="51" style="v" />Solomon was told, “Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon; for, behold, he is hanging onto the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let king Solomon swear to me first that he will not kill his servant with the sword.’”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="52" style="v" />Solomon said, “If he shows himself a worthy man, not a hair of his shall fall to the earth; but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die.”</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Now the days of David came near that he should die; and he commanded Solomon his son, saying, <verse number="2" style="v" />“I am going the way of all the earth.

    <verse number="42" style="v" />The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, “Didn’t I adjure you by the LORD, and warn you, saying, ‘Know for certain, that on the day you go out, and walk anywhere else, you shall surely die?’ You said to me, ‘The saying that I have heard is good.’ <verse number="43" style="v" />Why then have you not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have instructed you with?” <verse number="44" style="v" />The king said moreover to Shimei, “You know in your heart all the wickedness that you did to David my father. Therefore the LORD will return your wickedness on your own head. <verse number="45" style="v" />But king Solomon will be blessed, and David’s throne will be established before the LORD forever.” <verse number="46" style="v" />So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell on him, so that he died.

Its length was fifty cubits and its width thirty cubits; with a porch before them, and pillars and a threshold before them. <verse number="7" style="v" />He made the porch of the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgement; and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor. <verse number="8" style="v" />His house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch, was of the like work.

He came to king Solomon, and performed all his work. <verse number="15" style="v" />For he fashioned the two pillars of bronze, eighteen cubits high apiece; and a line of twelve cubits encircled either of them. <verse number="16" style="v" />He made two capitals of molten bronze, to set on the tops of the pillars. The height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits. <verse number="17" style="v" />There were nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital. <verse number="18" style="v" />So he made the pillars; and there were two rows around on the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars: and he did so for the other capital. <verse number="19" style="v" />The capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily work, four cubits. <verse number="20" style="v" />There were capitals above also on the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network. There were two hundred pomegranates in rows around the other capital. <verse number="21" style="v" />He set up the pillars at the porch of the temple. He set up the right pillar, and called its name Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called its name Boaz. <verse number="22" style="v" />On the top of the pillars was lily work: so the work of the pillars was finished. <verse number="23" style="v" />He made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in shape. Its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it. <verse number="24" style="v" />Under its brim around there were buds which encircled it for ten cubits, encircling the sea. The buds were in two rows, cast when it was cast. <verse number="25" style="v" />It stood on twelve oxen, three looking towards the north, and three looking towards the west, and three looking towards the south, and three looking towards the east; and the sea was set on them above, and all their hindquarters were inward. <verse number="26" style="v" />It was a hand width thick. Its brim was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held two thousand baths. <verse number="27" style="v" />He made the ten bases of bronze. The length of one base was four cubits, four cubits its width, and three cubits its height. <verse number="28" style="v" />The work of the bases was like this: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges; <verse number="29" style="v" />and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work. <verse number="30" style="v" />Every base had four bronze wheels, and axles of bronze; and the four feet of it had supports. The supports were cast beneath the basin, with wreaths at the side of each. <verse number="31" style="v" />Its mouth within the capital and above was a cubit. Its mouth was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on its mouth were engravings, and their panels were square, not round. <verse number="32" style="v" />The four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axles of the wheels were in the base. The height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit. <verse number="33" style="v" />The work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel. Their axles, and their rims, and their spokes, and their naves, were all of cast metal. <verse number="34" style="v" />There were four supports at the four corners of each base.

The weight of the bronze could not be determined. <verse number="48" style="v" />Solomon made all the vessels that were in the LORD’s house: the golden altar and the table that the show bread was on, of gold; <verse number="49" style="v" />and the lamp stands, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the inner sanctuary, of pure gold; and the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold; <verse number="50" style="v" />the cups, the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, of the temple, of gold. <verse number="51" style="v" />Thus all the work that king Solomon did in the LORD’s house was finished.

He laid its foundation with the loss of Abiram his firstborn, and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Segub, according to the LORD’s word, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.</para>
