Yes, they will worship with sacrifice and offering, and will vow a vow to the LORD, and will perform it. <verse number="22" style="v" />The LORD will strike Egypt, striking and healing.

    <verse number="1" style="v" />Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley of those who are overcome with wine! <verse number="2" style="v" />Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one. Like a storm of hail, a destroying storm, and like a storm of mighty waters overflowing, he will cast them down to the earth with his hand. <verse number="3" style="v" />The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden under foot. <verse number="4" style="v" />The fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley, shall be like the first-ripe fig before the summer; which someone picks and eats as soon as he sees it. <verse number="5" style="v" />In that day, the LORD of Armies will become a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty to the residue of his people, <verse number="6" style="v" />and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgement, and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.</para>

    <verse number="14" style="v" />Therefore hear the LORD’s word, you scoffers, that rule this people in Jerusalem: <verse number="15" style="v" />“Because you have said, ‘We have made a covenant with death, and we are in agreement with Sheol.<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">28:15 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Sheol is the place of the dead.</char></note> When the overflowing scourge passes through, it won’t come to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood.’” <verse number="16" style="v" />Therefore the Lord GOD says, “Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone of a sure foundation. He who believes shall not act hastily. <verse number="17" style="v" />I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line. The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters will overflow the hiding place. <verse number="18" style="v" />Your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">28:18 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Sheol is the place of the dead.</char></note> shall not stand. When the overflowing scourge passes through, then you will be trampled down by it. <verse number="19" style="v" />As often as it passes through, it will seize you; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day and by night; and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message.” <verse number="20" style="v" />For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the blanket is too narrow to wrap oneself in. <verse number="21" style="v" />For the LORD will rise up as on Mount Perazim. He will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do his work, his unusual work, and bring to pass his act, his extraordinary act. <verse number="22" style="v" />Now therefore don’t be scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord, the LORD of Armies, on the whole earth.</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all of the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. <verse number="2" style="v" />The king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a large army. He stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool in the fuller’s field highway. <verse number="3" style="v" />Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder came out to him.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />Rabshakeh said to them, “Now tell Hezekiah, ‘The great king, the king of Assyria, says, “What confidence is this in which you trust? <verse number="5" style="v" />I say that your counsel and strength for the war are only vain words. Now in whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me? <verse number="6" style="v" />Behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt, which if a man leans on it, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him. <verse number="7" style="v" />But if you tell me, ‘We trust in the LORD our God,’ isn’t that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar?’” <verse number="8" style="v" />Now therefore, please make a pledge to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them. <verse number="9" style="v" />How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? <verse number="10" style="v" />Have I come up now without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said to me, “Go up against this land, and destroy it.”’”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Don’t speak to us in the Jews’ language in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />But Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me only to your master and to you, to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?” <verse number="13" style="v" />Then Rabshakeh stood, and called out with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! <verse number="14" style="v" />The king says, ‘Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you. <verse number="15" style="v" />Don’t let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, “The LORD will surely deliver us. This city won’t be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”’ <verse number="16" style="v" />Don’t listen to Hezekiah, for the king of Assyria says, ‘Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and each of you eat from his vine, and each one from his fig tree, and each one of you drink the waters of his own cistern; <verse number="17" style="v" />until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards. <verse number="18" style="v" />Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, “The LORD will deliver us.” Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria? <verse number="19" style="v" />Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand? <verse number="20" style="v" />Who are they amongst all the gods of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?’”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" />But they remained silent, and said nothing in reply, for the king’s commandment was, “Don’t answer him.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</para>
  <chapter number="37" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />When king Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the LORD’s house. <verse number="2" style="v" />He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. <verse number="3" style="v" />They said to him, “Hezekiah says, ‘Today is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to give birth. <verse number="4" style="v" />It may be the LORD your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD your God has heard.

    <verse number="5" style="v" />So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</para>

I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”’”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he heard that he had departed from Lachish. <verse number="9" style="v" />He heard news concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “He has come out to fight against you.” When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, <verse number="10" style="v" />“Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, ‘Don’t let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem won’t be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.” <verse number="11" style="v" />Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. Shall you be delivered? <verse number="12" style="v" />Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar? <verse number="13" style="v" />Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?’”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to the LORD’s house, and spread it before the LORD. <verse number="15" style="v" />Hezekiah prayed to the LORD, saying, <verse number="16" style="v" />“LORD of Armies, the God of Israel, who is enthroned amongst the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth. <verse number="17" style="v" />Turn your ear, LORD, and hear. Open your eyes, LORD, and behold. Hear all of the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to defy the living God. <verse number="18" style="v" />Truly, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the countries and their land, <verse number="19" style="v" />and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them. <verse number="20" style="v" />Now therefore, LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are the LORD, even you only.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" />Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “The LORD, the God of Israel says, ‘Because you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, <verse number="22" style="v" />this is the word which the LORD has spoken concerning him.
