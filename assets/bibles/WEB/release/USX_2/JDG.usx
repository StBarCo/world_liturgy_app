    <verse number="1" style="v" />After the death of Joshua, the children of Israel asked of the LORD,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:1 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">When rendered in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, “LORD” or “GOD” is the translation of God’s Proper Name.</char></note> saying, “Who should go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="2" style="v" />The LORD said, “Judah shall go up. Behold,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:2 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">“Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" />Judah said to Simeon his brother, “Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your lot.” So Simeon went with him. <verse number="4" style="v" />Judah went up, and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand. They struck ten thousand men in Bezek. <verse number="5" style="v" />They found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and they fought against him. They struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites. <verse number="6" style="v" />But Adoni-Bezek fled. They pursued him, caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his big toes. <verse number="7" style="v" />Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their big toes cut off, scavenged under my table. As I have done, so God<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:7 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</char></note> has done to me.” They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there. <verse number="8" style="v" />The children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, took it, struck it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />After that, the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, and in the South, and in the lowland. <verse number="10" style="v" />Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron. (The name of Hebron before that was Kiriath Arba.) They struck Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />From there he went against the inhabitants of Debir. (The name of Debir before that was Kiriath Sepher.) <verse number="12" style="v" />Caleb said, “I will give Achsah my daughter as wife to the man who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it.” <verse number="13" style="v" />Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it, so he gave him Achsah his daughter as his wife.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />When she came, she got him to ask her father for a field. She got off her donkey; and Caleb said to her, “What would you like?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />She said to him, “Give me a blessing; because you have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water.” Then Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs. <verse number="16" style="v" />The children of the Kenite, Moses’ brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and lived with the people. <verse number="17" style="v" />Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. The name of the city was called Hormah. <verse number="18" style="v" />Also Judah took Gaza with its border, and Ashkelon with its border, and Ekron with its border. <verse number="19" style="v" />The LORD was with Judah, and drove out the inhabitants of the hill country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron. <verse number="20" style="v" />They gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said, and he drove the three sons of Anak out of there. <verse number="21" style="v" />The children of Benjamin didn’t drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem, but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the LORD was with them. <verse number="23" style="v" />The house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel. (The name of the city before that was Luz.) <verse number="24" style="v" />The watchers saw a man come out of the city, and they said to him, “Please show us the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with you.” <verse number="25" style="v" />He showed them the entrance into the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man and all his family go. <verse number="26" style="v" />The man went into the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="27" style="v" />Manasseh didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its towns, nor Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land. <verse number="28" style="v" />When Israel had grown strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labour, and didn’t utterly drive them out. <verse number="29" style="v" />Ephraim didn’t drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, but the Canaanites lived in Gezer amongst them. <verse number="30" style="v" />Zebulun didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites lived amongst them, and became subject to forced labour. <verse number="31" style="v" />Asher didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob; <verse number="32" style="v" />but the Asherites lived amongst the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they didn’t drive them out. <verse number="33" style="v" />Naphtali didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but he lived amongst the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath became subject to forced labour. <verse number="34" style="v" />The Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley; <verse number="35" style="v" />but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim. Yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to forced labour. <verse number="36" style="v" />The border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.</para>
  <chapter number="2" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />The LORD’s angel came up from Gilgal to Bochim. He said, “I brought you out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to give your fathers. I said, ‘I will never break my covenant with you. <verse number="2" style="v" />You shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land. You shall break down their altars.’ But you have not listened to my voice. Why have you done this? <verse number="3" style="v" />Therefore I also said, ‘I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.’”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />When the LORD’s angel spoke these words to all the children of Israel, the people lifted up their voice and wept. <verse number="5" style="v" />They called the name of that place Bochim,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">2:5 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">“Bochim” means “weepers”.</char></note> and they sacrificed there to the LORD. <verse number="6" style="v" />Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel each went to his inheritance to possess the land. <verse number="7" style="v" />The people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of the LORD that he had worked for Israel. <verse number="8" style="v" />Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being one hundred and ten years old. <verse number="9" style="v" />They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath Heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash. <verse number="10" style="v" />After all that generation were gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them who didn’t know the LORD, nor the work which he had done for Israel. <verse number="11" style="v" />The children of Israel did that which was evil in the LORD’s sight, and served the Baals. <verse number="12" style="v" />They abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed themselves down to them; and they provoked the LORD to anger. <verse number="13" style="v" />They abandoned the LORD, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth. <verse number="14" style="v" />The LORD’s anger burnt against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of raiders who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies. <verse number="15" style="v" />Wherever they went out, the LORD’s hand was against them for evil, as the LORD had spoken, and as the LORD had sworn to them; and they were very distressed. <verse number="16" style="v" />The LORD raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who plundered them. <verse number="17" style="v" />Yet they didn’t listen to their judges; for they prostituted themselves to other gods, and bowed themselves down to them. They quickly turned away from the way in which their fathers walked, obeying the LORD’s commandments. They didn’t do so. <verse number="18" style="v" />When the LORD raised up judges for them, then the LORD was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for it grieved the LORD because of their groaning by reason of those who oppressed them and troubled them. <verse number="19" style="v" />But when the judge was dead, they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers in following other gods to serve them and to bow down to them. They didn’t cease what they were doing, or give up their stubborn ways. <verse number="20" style="v" />The LORD’s anger burnt against Israel; and he said, “Because this nation transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not listened to my voice, <verse number="21" style="v" />I also will no longer drive out any of the nations that Joshua left when he died from before them; <verse number="22" style="v" />that by them I may test Israel, to see if they will keep the LORD’s way to walk therein, as their fathers kept it, or not.” <verse number="23" style="v" />So the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily. He didn’t deliver them into Joshua’s hand.</para>
  <chapter number="3" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to test Israel by them, even as many as had not known all the wars of Canaan; <verse number="2" style="v" />only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at least those who knew nothing of it before: <verse number="3" style="v" />the five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath. <verse number="4" style="v" />They were left to test Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to the LORD’s commandments, which he commanded their fathers by Moses. <verse number="5" style="v" />The children of Israel lived amongst the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. <verse number="6" style="v" />They took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods. <verse number="7" style="v" />The children of Israel did that which was evil in the LORD’s sight, and forgot the LORD their God, and served the Baals and the Asheroth. <verse number="8" style="v" />Therefore the LORD’s anger burnt against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years. <verse number="9" style="v" />When the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a saviour to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother. <verse number="10" style="v" />The LORD’s Spirit came on him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and the LORD delivered Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand. His hand prevailed against Cushan Rishathaim. <verse number="11" style="v" />The land had rest forty years, then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the LORD’s sight, and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the LORD’s sight. <verse number="13" style="v" />He gathered the children of Ammon and Amalek to himself; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees. <verse number="14" style="v" />The children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. <verse number="15" style="v" />But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a saviour for them: Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. The children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab. <verse number="16" style="v" />Ehud made himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">3:16 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimetres.</char></note> in length; and he wore it under his clothing on his right thigh. <verse number="17" style="v" />He offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man. <verse number="18" style="v" />When Ehud had finished offering the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute. <verse number="19" style="v" />But he himself turned back from the stone idols that were by Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.”</para>
  <para style="p">The king said, “Keep silence!” All who stood by him left him.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. Ehud said, “I have a message from God to you.” He arose out of his seat. <verse number="21" style="v" />Ehud put out his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body. <verse number="22" style="v" />The handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for he didn’t draw the sword out of his body; and it came out behind. <verse number="23" style="v" />Then Ehud went out onto the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room on him, and locked them.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="24" style="v" />After he had gone, his servants came and saw that the doors of the upper room were locked. They said, “Surely he is covering his feet<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">3:24 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">or, “relieving himself”.</char></note> in the upper room.” <verse number="25" style="v" />They waited until they were ashamed; and behold, he didn’t open the doors of the upper room. Therefore they took the key and opened them, and behold, their lord had fallen down dead on the floor.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="26" style="v" />Ehud escaped while they waited, passed beyond the stone idols, and escaped to Seirah. <verse number="27" style="v" />When he had come, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he led them.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="28" style="v" />He said to them, “Follow me; for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” They followed him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and didn’t allow any man to pass over. <verse number="29" style="v" />They struck at that time about ten thousand men of Moab, every strong man and every man of valour. No man escaped. <verse number="30" style="v" />So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. Then the land had rest eighty years.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="31" style="v" />After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad. He also saved Israel.</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the LORD’s sight, when Ehud was dead. <verse number="2" style="v" />The LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles. <verse number="3" style="v" />The children of Israel cried to the LORD, for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and he mightily oppressed the children of Israel for twenty years. <verse number="4" style="v" />Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, judged Israel at that time. <verse number="5" style="v" />She lived under Deborah’s palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgement. <verse number="6" style="v" />She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, “Hasn’t the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded, ‘Go and lead the way to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun? <verse number="7" style="v" />I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.’”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />She said, “I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the journey that you take won’t be for your honour; for the LORD will sell Sisera into a woman’s hand.” Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh. Ten thousand men followed him; and Deborah went up with him. <verse number="11" style="v" />Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab, Moses’ brother-in-law, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh. <verse number="12" style="v" />They told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to Mount Tabor. <verse number="13" style="v" />Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />Deborah said to Barak, “Go; for this is the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hand. Hasn’t the LORD gone out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him. <verse number="15" style="v" />The LORD confused Sisera, all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak. Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled away on his feet. <verse number="16" style="v" />But Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth of the Gentiles; and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword. There was not a man left.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" />However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. <verse number="18" style="v" />Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; don’t be afraid.” He came in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />He said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.”</para>
  <para style="p">She opened a container of milk, and gave him a drink, and covered him.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />He said to her, “Stand in the door of the tent, and if any man comes and enquires of you, and says, ‘Is there any man here?’ you shall say, ‘No.’”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" />Then Jael, Heber’s wife, took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground, for he was in a deep sleep; so he fainted and died. <verse number="22" style="v" />Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek.” He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent peg was in his temples. <verse number="23" style="v" />So God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel on that day. <verse number="24" style="v" />The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</para>
