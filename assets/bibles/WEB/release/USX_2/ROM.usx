    <verse number="1" style="v" />Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the Good News of God, <verse number="2" style="v" />which he promised before through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, <verse number="3" style="v" />concerning his Son, who was born of the offspring<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:3 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">or, seed</char></note> of David according to the flesh, <verse number="4" style="v" />who was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, <verse number="5" style="v" />through whom we received grace and apostleship for obedience of faith amongst all the nations for his name’s sake; <verse number="6" style="v" />amongst whom you are also called to belong to Jesus Christ; <verse number="7" style="v" />to all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world. <verse number="9" style="v" />For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the Good News of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers, <verse number="10" style="v" />requesting, if by any means now at last I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you. <verse number="11" style="v" />For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end that you may be established; <verse number="12" style="v" />that is, that I with you may be encouraged in you, each of us by the other’s faith, both yours and mine.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />Now I don’t desire to have you unaware, brothers, that I often planned to come to you, and was hindered so far, that I might have some fruit amongst you also, even as amongst the rest of the Gentiles. <verse number="14" style="v" />I am debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to the wise and to the foolish. <verse number="15" style="v" />So as much as is in me, I am eager to preach the Good News to you also who are in Rome. <verse number="16" style="v" />For I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ, because it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first, and also for the Greek. <verse number="17" style="v" />For in it is revealed God’s righteousness from faith to faith. As it is written, “But the righteous shall live by faith.”<note caller="+" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">1:17 </char><char style="xt" closed="false"><ref loc="HAB 2:4">Habakkuk 2:4</ref></char></note> <verse number="18" style="v" />For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, <verse number="19" style="v" />because that which is known of God is revealed in them, for God revealed it to them. <verse number="20" style="v" />For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity, that they may be without excuse. <verse number="21" style="v" />Because knowing God, they didn’t glorify him as God, and didn’t give thanks, but became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless heart was darkened.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, <verse number="23" style="v" />and traded the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, four-footed animals, and creeping things. <verse number="24" style="v" />Therefore God also gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonoured amongst themselves; <verse number="25" style="v" />who exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="26" style="v" />For this reason, God gave them up to vile passions. For their women changed the natural function into that which is against nature. <verse number="27" style="v" />Likewise also the men, leaving the natural function of the woman, burnt in their lust towards one another, men doing what is inappropriate with men, and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error. <verse number="28" style="v" />Even as they refused to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting; <verse number="29" style="v" />being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil habits, secret slanderers, <verse number="30" style="v" />backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, <verse number="31" style="v" />without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, unforgiving, unmerciful; <verse number="32" style="v" />who, knowing the ordinance of God, that those who practise such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also approve of those who practise them.</para>
  <chapter number="2" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practise the same things. <verse number="2" style="v" />We know that the judgement of God is according to truth against those who practise such things. <verse number="3" style="v" />Do you think this, O man who judges those who practise such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgement of God? <verse number="4" style="v" />Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance? <verse number="5" style="v" />But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgement of God; <verse number="6" style="v" />who “will pay back to everyone according to their works:”<note caller="+" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">2:6 </char><char style="xt" closed="false"><ref loc="PSA 62:12">Psalm 62:12</ref>; <ref loc="PRO 24:12">Proverbs 24:12</ref></char></note> <verse number="7" style="v" />to those who by perseverance in well-doing seek for glory, honour, and incorruptibility, eternal life; <verse number="8" style="v" />but to those who are self-seeking, and don’t obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath, indignation, <verse number="9" style="v" />oppression, and anguish on every soul of man who does evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />But glory, honour, and peace go to every man who does good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. <verse number="11" style="v" />For there is no partiality with God. <verse number="12" style="v" />For as many as have sinned without the law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. <verse number="13" style="v" />For it isn’t the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified <verse number="14" style="v" />(for when Gentiles who don’t have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves, <verse number="15" style="v" />in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts amongst themselves accusing or else excusing them) <verse number="16" style="v" />in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Jesus Christ.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" />Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, rest on the law, glory in God, <verse number="18" style="v" />know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law, <verse number="19" style="v" />and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, <verse number="20" style="v" />a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth. <verse number="21" style="v" />You therefore who teach another, don’t you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn’t steal, do you steal? <verse number="22" style="v" />You who say a man shouldn’t commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? <verse number="23" style="v" />You who glory in the law, do you dishonour God by disobeying the law? <verse number="24" style="v" />For “the name of God is blasphemed amongst the Gentiles because of you,” <note caller="+" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">2:24 </char><char style="xt" closed="false"><ref loc="ISA 52:5">Isaiah 52:5</ref>; <ref loc="EZK 36:22">Ezekiel 36:22</ref></char></note> just as it is written. <verse number="25" style="v" />For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. <verse number="26" style="v" />If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won’t his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision? <verse number="27" style="v" />Won’t the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfils the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law? <verse number="28" style="v" />For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh; <verse number="29" style="v" />but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.</para>
  <chapter number="3" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Then what advantage does the Jew have? Or what is the profit of circumcision? <verse number="2" style="v" />Much in every way! Because first of all, they were entrusted with the revelations of God. <verse number="3" style="v" />For what if some were without faith? Will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God? <verse number="4" style="v" />May it never be! Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar. As it is written,</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what will we say? Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I speak like men do. <verse number="6" style="v" />May it never be! For then how will God judge the world? <verse number="7" style="v" />For if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner? <verse number="8" style="v" />Why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), “Let’s do evil, that good may come?” Those who say so are justly condemned.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />What then? Are we better than they? No, in no way. For we previously warned both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin. <verse number="10" style="v" />As it is written,</para>

For there is no distinction, <verse number="23" style="v" />for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God; <verse number="24" style="v" />being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; <verse number="25" style="v" />whom God sent to be an atoning sacrifice,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">3:25 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">or, a propitiation</char></note> through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness through the passing over of prior sins, in God’s forbearance; <verse number="26" style="v" />to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time; that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus.</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather, has found according to the flesh? <verse number="2" style="v" />For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not towards God. <verse number="3" style="v" />For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.”<note caller="+" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">4:3 </char><char style="xt" closed="false"><ref loc="GEN 15:6">Genesis 15:6</ref></char></note> <verse number="4" style="v" />Now to him who works, the reward is not counted as grace, but as something owed. <verse number="5" style="v" />But to him who doesn’t work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness. <verse number="6" style="v" />Even as David also pronounces blessing on the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works,</para>

    <verse number="9" style="v" />Is this blessing then pronounced on the circumcised, or on the uncircumcised also? For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness. <verse number="10" style="v" />How then was it counted? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. <verse number="11" style="v" />He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they might be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might also be accounted to them. <verse number="12" style="v" />He is the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision. <verse number="13" style="v" />For the promise to Abraham and to his offspring that he should be heir of the world wasn’t through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. <verse number="14" style="v" />For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of no effect. <verse number="15" style="v" />For the law produces wrath, for where there is no law, neither is there disobedience. <verse number="16" style="v" />For this cause it is of faith, that it may be according to grace, to the end that the promise may be sure to all the offspring, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all. <verse number="17" style="v" />As it is written, “I have made you a father of many nations.”<note caller="+" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">4:17 </char><char style="xt" closed="false"><ref loc="GEN 17:5">Genesis 17:5</ref></char></note> This is in the presence of him whom he believed: God, who gives life to the dead, and calls the things that are not, as though they were. <verse number="18" style="v" />Besides hope, Abraham in hope believed, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, “So will your offspring be.”<note caller="+" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">4:18 </char><char style="xt" closed="false"><ref loc="GEN 15:5">Genesis 15:5</ref></char></note> <verse number="19" style="v" />Without being weakened in faith, he didn’t consider his own body, already having been worn out, (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah’s womb. <verse number="20" style="v" />Yet, looking to the promise of God, he didn’t waver through unbelief, but grew strong through faith, giving glory to God, <verse number="21" style="v" />and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was also able to perform. <verse number="22" style="v" />Therefore it also was “credited to him for righteousness.”<note caller="+" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">4:22 </char><char style="xt" closed="false"><ref loc="GEN 15:6">Genesis 15:6</ref></char></note> <verse number="23" style="v" />Now it was not written that it was accounted to him for his sake alone, <verse number="24" style="v" />but for our sake also, to whom it will be accounted, who believe in him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead, <verse number="25" style="v" />who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ; <verse number="2" style="v" />through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand. We rejoice in hope of the glory of God. <verse number="3" style="v" />Not only this, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces perseverance; <verse number="4" style="v" />and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope: <verse number="5" style="v" />and hope doesn’t disappoint us, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us. <verse number="6" style="v" />For while we were yet weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. <verse number="7" style="v" />For one will hardly die for a righteous man. Yet perhaps for a good person someone would even dare to die. <verse number="8" style="v" />But God commends his own love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we will be saved from God’s wrath through him. <verse number="10" style="v" />For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we will be saved by his life.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />Not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation. <verse number="12" style="v" />Therefore as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin; so death passed to all men, because all sinned. <verse number="13" style="v" />For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not charged when there is no law. <verse number="14" style="v" />Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those whose sins weren’t like Adam’s disobedience, who is a foreshadowing of him who was to come. <verse number="15" style="v" />But the free gift isn’t like the trespass. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many. <verse number="16" style="v" />The gift is not as through one who sinned; for the judgement came by one to condemnation, but the free gift came of many trespasses to justification. <verse number="17" style="v" />For if by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; so much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ. <verse number="18" style="v" />So then as through one trespass, all men were condemned; even so through one act of righteousness, all men were justified to life. <verse number="19" style="v" />For as through the one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one, many will be made righteous. <verse number="20" style="v" />The law came in that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace abounded more exceedingly; <verse number="21" style="v" />that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? <verse number="2" style="v" />May it never be! We who died to sin, how could we live in it any longer? <verse number="3" style="v" />Or don’t you know that all we who were baptised into Christ Jesus were baptised into his death? <verse number="4" style="v" />We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life. <verse number="5" style="v" />For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we will also be part of his resurrection; <verse number="6" style="v" />knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin. <verse number="7" style="v" />For he who has died has been freed from sin. <verse number="8" style="v" />But if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him; <verse number="9" style="v" />knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over him! <verse number="10" style="v" />For the death that he died, he died to sin one time; but the life that he lives, he lives to God. <verse number="11" style="v" />Thus consider yourselves also to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</para>

    <verse number="19" style="v" />I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh, for as you presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to wickedness upon wickedness, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness for sanctification. <verse number="20" style="v" />For when you were servants of sin, you were free from righteousness. <verse number="21" style="v" />What fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. <verse number="22" style="v" />But now, being made free from sin and having become servants of God, you have your fruit of sanctification and the result of eternal life. <verse number="23" style="v" />For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</para>

But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man. <verse number="4" style="v" />Therefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might produce fruit to God. <verse number="5" style="v" />For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were through the law worked in our members to bring out fruit to death. <verse number="6" style="v" />But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.</para>

    <verse number="13" style="v" />Did then that which is good become death to me? May it never be! But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, was producing death in me through that which is good; that through the commandment sin might become exceedingly sinful. <verse number="14" style="v" />For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin. <verse number="15" style="v" />For I don’t know what I am doing. For I don’t practise what I desire to do; but what I hate, that I do. <verse number="16" style="v" />But if what I don’t desire, that I do, I consent to the law that it is good. <verse number="17" style="v" />So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me. <verse number="18" style="v" />For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing. For desire is present with me, but I don’t find it doing that which is good. <verse number="19" style="v" />For the good which I desire, I don’t do; but the evil which I don’t desire, that I practise. <verse number="20" style="v" />But if what I don’t desire, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me. <verse number="21" style="v" />I find then the law that, to me, while I desire to do good, evil is present. <verse number="22" style="v" />For I delight in God’s law after the inward person, <verse number="23" style="v" />but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members. <verse number="24" style="v" />What a wretched man I am! Who will deliver me out of the body of this death? <verse number="25" style="v" />I thank God through Jesus Christ, our Lord!

    <verse number="11" style="v" />I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy. <verse number="12" style="v" />Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness? <verse number="13" style="v" />For I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry; <verse number="14" style="v" />if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them. <verse number="15" style="v" />For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead? <verse number="16" style="v" />If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches. <verse number="17" style="v" />But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in amongst them and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree, <verse number="18" style="v" />don’t boast over the branches. But if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you. <verse number="19" style="v" />You will say then, “Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.” <verse number="20" style="v" />True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Don’t be conceited, but fear; <verse number="21" style="v" />for if God didn’t spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. <verse number="22" style="v" />See then the goodness and severity of God. Towards those who fell, severity; but towards you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off. <verse number="23" style="v" />They also, if they don’t continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. <verse number="24" style="v" />For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</para>
