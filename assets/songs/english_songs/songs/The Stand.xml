  <title>The Stand</title>
  <lyrics>[1]
.G
 You stood before creation
.C
 Eternity in Your hand
.G/B                      Em
 You spoke the earth into motion
.            C
 My soul now to stand


[2]
.G
 You stood before my failure
.    C
 And carried the cross for my shame
.   G/B                   Em
 My sin weighed upon Your shoulders
.               C
 My soul now to stand


[P]
.              C  Am
 So what can I say
.                 Em
 And what could I do 
.               C       D
 But offer this heart O God
.              Em G
 Completely to You
---
[3]
.   G
 So I'll walk upon salvation
.     C
 Your Spirit alive in me
.     G/B                  Em
 This life to declare Your promise
.               C
 My soul now to stand


[C]
.C         G
 So I'll stand
.     D             Em             C
 With arms high and heart abandoned
.   G          D       Em         C
 In awe of the One who gave it all ||
.     G
 I'll stand
.   D            Em
 My soul Lord to You surrendered
.C     G     D    Em
 All I am is Yours</lyrics>
