  <lyrics>[Intro]
.C Am  F

[1]
.C                 Am    F
 Again the wind is raging
.C                  Am
 But I will not be shaken
.F     C                 Am  F
 For I know, who's in control
.C                   Am    F
 The greater One within me
.C                     Am
 Is more than what's against me
.     F      C          Am  F
 He's in control, for I know

[C]
.C                              G
 He'll see me through like before
.      C/E          F/A
 He is Lord, He is Lord
.C                  G
 I'm not afraid anymore
.      C/E          F/A
 He is Lord, He is Lord

[2]
.C                    Am    F
 The One who holds tomorrow
.C                  Am
 Is calling me to follow
.F           C           Am  F
 Heart and soul, I will go
.C                 Am    F
 The Maker of the promise
.C                     Am
 Will finish what He started
.F           C           Am  F
 Heart and soul, I will go

[B]
.F                    C/E       G
 And at His name the mountains bow
.                      C/E     F
 Lift every voice declare it now

 Jesus Christ is Lord
.F                     C/E        G
 And with a shout the walls come down
.                     C/E      F
 Lift every voice declare it now
.             C    G    C/E
 Jesus Christ is Lord
