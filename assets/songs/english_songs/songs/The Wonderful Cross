  <title>The Wonderful Cross</title>
  <lyrics>[1]
.D                  G        D
 When I survey the wondrous cross
.D              G         D    A
 On which the prince of glory died,
.D                   G        D
 My richest gain I count but loss,
.D         A          C2        D
 And pour contempt on all my pride.

.D     G              D
 Oh the wonderful cross,
.      G              D
 Oh the wonderful cross
.         G
 Bids me come and die
.     D               A
 and find that I may truly live.
.      G          D
 O the wonderful cross,
.      G          D
 O the wonderful cross
.         G
 All who gather here
.   D                   A
 By grace draw near and bless Your name.

.D                  G        D
 See from his head, His hands, His feet,
.D              G         D    A
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down.
.D                   G        D
 Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,
.D         A          C2        D
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown.

.D                  G        D
 Were the whole relm of nature mine,
.D              G         D    A
 That were an of-f’ring far to small.
.D                   G        D
 Love so amazing so divine,
.D         A          C2        D
 Demands my soul, my life, my all.</lyrics>
