.    E                            
 How lovely is Your dwelling place
.A           B
 Oh Lord Almighty ||
.E                                 B
 My soul longs and even faints for You ||
.    E                         A
 For here my heart is satisfied 
.            B
 Within Your presence ||
.  E                               B
 I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings

.          A
 Better is one day in Your courts
.          B
 Better is one day in Your house ||
.          A
 Better is one day in Your courts
.               B
 Than thousands elsewhere

 One thing I ask and I would seek,
.A              B
 To see Your beauty ||

 To find You in the place Your glory dwells ||

 For here my heart is satisfied  
.            B
 Within Your presence ||
.  E                               B
 I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings

 my heart and flesh cry out
.A                  B
 For You the living God
.C#m7                B     A   B
 Your spirit's water to my soul ||

 I've tasted and I've seen
.A
 Come once again to me ||
.E/G#
 I will draw near to You

 I will draw near to You</lyrics>
