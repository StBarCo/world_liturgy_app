  <lyrics>[1]
.   C                  F    C
 My soul finds rest in God alone,
.   C        Am    G
 My rock and my salvation.
.  C                F         C
 A fortress strong against my foes,
.    C      F      G  C
 And I will not be shaken.
.       F                             C
 Though lips may bless and hearts may curse
.    F         Dm     Gsus4  G
 And lies like arrows pierce me
.     C               F        C
 I'll fix my heart on righteousness
.     C       F       G     C
 I'll look to Him who hears me


[C]
.  G               F
 O praise Him hallelujah,
.     C              F
 My Delight and my Reward!
.    G             F
 Everlasting never failing,
.     Dm9    G  C
 My Redeemer my God.


[B]
.  F             Am
 O praise Him! O praise Him!
.     Gsus4       F
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

.     C               F    C
 Find rest my soul in God alone,
. C       Am          G
 Amid the world's temptations.
.     C             F      C
 When evil seeks to take a hold,
.     C        F     G C
 I'll cling to my salvation.
.       F                      C
 Though riches come and riches go
.      F        Am     Gsus4 G
 Don't set your heart upon   them
.    C                 F       C
 The fields of hope in which I sow
.    C     F      G  C
 Are harvested in Heaven


[3]
.     C              F    C
 I'll set my gaze on God alone,
.    C        Am      G
 And trust in Him completely.
.     C              F      C
 With every day pour out my soul,
.    C       F         G  C
 And He will prove His mercy.
.       F                      C
 Though life is but a fleeting breath.
.  F        Am      Gsus4 G
 A sigh too deep to mea---sure.
.   C                    F        C
 My King has crushed the curse of death,
.    C    F       G C
 And I am His for-e-ver..</lyrics>
