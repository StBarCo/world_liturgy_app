  <title>Reign in Us</title>
  <lyrics>[1]
.    Em
 You thought of us
.                   C
 Before the world began to breathe
.    D                                G
 You knew our names before we came to be ||
.    Em                          C
 You saw the very day we'd fall away from You
.        D                         G
 And how desperately we need to be redeemed

[P]
.      C         D
 Lord Jesus come lead us
.       Am                D
 We're desperate for Your touch

[C]
.G                        D
 Oh Great and Mighty One, with one desire we come
.Am      Em            C              D
 That You would reign, that You would reign in us ||
.G                           D
 We're offering up our lives, a living sacrifice
.Am      Em          C                D
 That You would reign, that You would reign in us

---
[2]
.Em                            C
 Spirit of the Living God fall fresh again
.     D                                G
 Come search our hearts and purify our lives ||
.   Em                                   C
 We need Your perfect love, we need Your discipline
.      D                             G
 We're lost unless You guide us with Your light

[B1]
.       D             C         G
 We cry out for Your life to revive us
.    D            C       G
 Cry out for Your love to define us
.     D            C        G
 Cry out for Your mercy to keep us
.Em                  Dsus  D
 blameless until You return

[B2]
.    C            G        D
 So, reign please reign in us
.                C          G         D
 Come purify our hearts, we need Your touch ||
.                       C         G       D
 Come cleanse us like a flood and send us out
.                          C         G       D
 So the world may know You reign You reign in us</lyrics>
