  <lyrics>[1]
.B                  C#m
 At the foot of the cross
.      A                      E
 Where grace and suffering meet
.B                     C#m
 You have shown me Your love
.            A                   B
 Through the judgment You received
.          F#m   E/G#  A  B
 And You've won my  heart
.          F#m   E/G#  A  A2/B
 Yes You've won my  heart      
.
 Now I Can


[C]
.E           B            F#m   E
 Trade these ashes in for beauty
.E           B               F#m
 And wear forgiveness like a crown
.E         B                F#m
 Coming to kiss the feet of mercy
.      C#m   B      F#m
 I lay every burden down
.       B           E
 At the foot of the cross

 You have given me life

 Through the death You bore for me
