.G    C G    D G

[1]
.         G         C       G               Em      D         G
 Mine are days that God has numbered; I was made to walk with Him
.      G        C       G               Em       D       G
 Yet I look for worldly treasure and forsake the King of Kings
.    G/B     C            G               D                G
 But mine is hope in my Redeemer though I fall His love is sure
.    G/B         C             G             D      Em7 G
 For Christ has paid for every failing; I am His forevermore

[2]
.         G        C        G               Em      D    G
 Mine are tears in times of sorrow darkness not yet understood
.            G      C      G              Em     D       G
 Through the valley I must travel where I see no earthly good
.    G/B     C                     G              D                    G
 But mine is peace that flows from heaven and the strength in times of need
.  G/B     C                G                  D         Em7     G
 I know my pain will not be wasted. Christ completes His work in me

[3]
.         G         C   G                  Em   D       G
 Mine are days here as a stranger, pilgrim on the narrow way
.         G        C      G                Em     D       G
 One with Christ I will encounter harm and hatred for His name
.    G/B     C               G              D                 G
 But mine is armour for this battle strong enough to last the war
.    G/B    C              G            D      Em7    G
 And He has said He will deliver safely to the golden shore

[Refrain]
.    G/B      C            G            D               G
 And mine are keys to Zion city where beside the King I walk
.    G/B      C                   G                  D       Em7 G
 For there my heart has found its treasure Christ is mine forevermore

[B]
.       G               C            G            D
 Come rejoice now, O my soul for His love is my reward
.        G                C               D       Em7 G
 Fear is gone and hope is sure. Christ is mine forevermore</lyrics>
