  <lyrics>[1]
.D                    A       Bm   G
 If love endured that ancient cross
.D                  A     Bm       G
 How precious is my Saviour’s blood
.D                    A          Bm      G
 The beauty of heaven wrapped in my shame
.D                  A             Bm
 The image of love upon death’s frame


[P1]
.G                    (Dm)     A
 If having my heart was worth the pain
.G                     (Dm)      A      D/F#
 What joy could You see beyond the grave
.G                    (Dm)   A
 If love found my soul worth dying for


[C]
.        D           A   Bm7
 How wonderful, how glorious
.   G   D               A  Bm7
 My Saviour’s scars, victorious
.   F#m7   Gmaj7        A       Bm7
 My chains are gone, my debt is paid
.     G        D                  A   G
 From death to life and grace to grace
---
[2]
 If heaven now owns that vacant tomb
 How great is the hope that lives in You
 The passion that tore through hell like a rose
 The promise that rolled back death and its stone


[P2]
 If freedom is worth the life You raised
 Oh where is my sin, where is my shame
 If love paid it all to have my heart


[Inst]
.G A Bm7 G D A


[B]
.G                            A
 When I see that cross, I see freedom
.Bm7                             G
 When I see that grave, I’ll see Jesus
.D                                        A
 And from death to life, I will sing Your praise
.A             D/F#
 In the wonder of Your grace


[T]
.G                A         Bm7
 How my soul will sing Your praise
.                 G    D
 In the wonder of Your grace
.                           A
 How my soul will sing Your praise</lyrics>
