[2]
 For my pardon this I see, 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus
 For my cleansing this my plea
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus

[3]
 Nothing can for sin atone
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus
 Naught of good that I have done
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[4]
 This is all my hope and peace 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus
 This is all my righteousness
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus
