  <title>Back to You</title>
  <lyrics> I'm sorry, Lord, for the heir I've become
 I never thought that I would be this far from home
 All the love you gave never lied in waste
 It keeps me hanging on
 When I look around and there's nowhere else to run

 These filthy hands I lift in faith
 Longing for redeeming grace
 To cleanse my heart and bring me back to You

 Bring me back to You
 I'm so undeserving of the love
 You so freely offer us
 I will place my trust in You and never look back
 Because of who You are, because of what You've done

 Forgive me, Lord, for my ungrateful heart
 When I thought that I would be better off alone
 When deception came, thought I had the strength to fight foolishness away
 I forgot where all my strength comes from
---
 These filthy hands I lift to praise
 A holy God with loves that saves
 A wounded soul in need of Your embrace

 Bring me back to You
 I'm so undeserving of the love
 You so freely offer us
 I will place my trust in You and never look back
 Because of who You are, because of what You've done

 When I see Your open arms of love
 Welcoming Your prodigal home
 There's nothing that can hold me back from You

 So I will run
 Yes I will run
 God I will run
 Yes I will run
 To you
 God we will run to you
 Ohhh</lyrics>
