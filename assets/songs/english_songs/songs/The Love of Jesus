  <lyrics>[1]
.C
 By His wounds we are healed
.                               F
 By His stripes we're made whole
.
 Body broken for us
.                    Am
 For our sin to atone
.            F            C
 Holy is the Lord Almighty

[2]
.C
 Perfect lamb that was slain
.                      F
 Once for all to redeem
.
 Perfect love took our place
.                      Am
 Now forever we'll sing
.            F            C
 Holy is the Lord Almighty

[C]
.        F           C
 Oh the love of Jesus
.       Am     [G/E] G
 Oh the love of Jesus
.       F       G    Am
 Oh the love of Jesus
.      F         C
 Is enough for me

.C
 Author of all my hope
.                     F
 Keeper of all my days
.
 Jesus You go before
.                         Am
 Your grace has made a way
.            F            C
 Holy is the Lord Almighty


[B]
.G           Am      F       C
 Your strength in my weakness
.G        Am         F       C
 Your word lights my darkness
.G        Am     F     C
 Your peace everlasting
.           G     Am     F   C
 Singing holy, holy is our God</lyrics>
