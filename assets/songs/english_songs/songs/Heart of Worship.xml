  <lyrics>[1]
.D              A     
 When the music fades
.                    Em             
 And all is stripped away
.             A7sus4
 And I simply come ||
.D               A                          
 Longing just to bring, 
.                    Em
 Something that's of worth
.                     A7sus4
 That will bless your heart

[p]
.Em             D/F#        A
 I'll bring You more than a song
.              Em       
 For a song in itself 
.            D/F#            A    
 Is not what You have required ||
.Em              D/F#       A
 You search much deeper within
.                          Em
 Through the way things appear
.               D/F#    A
 You're looking into my heart

[C]
.D                      A2/C#
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship
.         Em        D/F#     G         A       D
 And it's all about You, its all about You, Jesus ||
.                       A2/C#
 I'm sorry Lord for the things I've made it
.          Em        D/F# G         A      D
 When it's all about You, all about You, Jesus

.D               A                     
 King of endless worth, 
.               Em
 No one could express
.             A7sus4 
 How much You deserve ||
.D                   A
 Though I'm weak and poor
.              Em 
 All I have is Yours
.             A7sus4 
 Every single breath</lyrics>
