 There's nothing worth more
.                    D
 That will ever come close  ||

 No thing can compare

 You're our living hope
.              D
 Your Presence, Lord

 Holy Spirit You are welcome here
.      D                              Bm
 Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere ||
.      A
 Your Glory God is what our hearts long for
.        D                Bm       A
 To be overcome by Your Presence Lord

.A
 I've tasted and seen
.                   D
 Of the sweetest of loves ||

 Where my heart becomes free

 And my shame is undone
.                 D
 In Your Presence, Lord

 Let us become more aware of Your Presence

 Let us experience the Glory of Your Goodness
