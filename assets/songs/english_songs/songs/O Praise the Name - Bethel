  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.G C G/B C

[1]
.          G
 I cast my mind to Calvary
.            D                 Em
 Where Jesus bled and died for me
.          C                     G/B
 I see His wounds, His hands His feet
.          D              Gsus G
 My Savior on that cursed tree

[2]
.         G
 His body bound and drenched in tears
.              D                Em
 They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
.             C               G/B
 The entrance sealed by heavy stone
.        D             Gsus G
 Messiah still and all alone

[C]
.  G                      C        G
 O praise the name of the Lord our God
.  Em                 Dsus D
 O praise His name forever more
.    G/B                  C        G
 For endless days we will sing You praise
.   C        D        G
 Oh Lord, oh Lord our God

[3]
.            G
 Then on the third, at break of dawn
.           D             Em
 The son of Heaven rose again
.           C                     G/B
 O trampled death, where is your sting?
.           D                   Gsus G
 The angels roar for Christ the King

[4]
.         G
 He shall return in robes of white
.            D                    Em
 The blazing sun shall pierce the night
.           C              G/B
 And I will rise among the saints
.             D               Gsus G
 My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face

[t]
 You overcame the grave
 and You're alive in me today

[t2] 
.G(Em)      D           C
 Praise the Lord, oh my soul
.           G
 Praise the Lord
