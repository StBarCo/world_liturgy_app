  <lyrics>[1]
.D             C#m
 My heart a storm, clouds raging deep within
.D               C#m
 The Prince of peace
.
 Came bursting through the wind
.F#m             C#m
  The violent sky held its breath
.D             C#m
 And in Your light I found rest

[C]
.A                     Bm7
 Tearing through the night
.                F#m
 Riding on the storm
.                  D
 Staring down the fight
.                   A
 My eyes found Yours
.               Bm7
 Shining like the sun
.                   F#m
 Striding through my fear
.               C#m
 The Prince of peace
.            D
 Met me there
.C#m              D C#m
 You heard my prayer
---
[2]
.D               C#m
 Hope like the sun, light piercing through the dark
.D               C#m
 The Prince of peace came and broke into my heart
.F#m             C#m              D
 The violent cross, the empty grave
.             C#m
 And in Your light I found grace

[B1]
.     A
 Your love surrounds me
.        Bm7
 When my thoughts wage war
.     F#m
 When night screams terror
.           D
 There Your voice will roar
.     A
 Come death or shadow
.      Bm7                        F#m    D
 God I know Your light will meet me there
.     A
 When fear comes knocking
.             Bm7
 There You'll be my guard
.     F#m
 When day breeds trouble
.             D
 There You'll hold my heart
.     A
 Come storm or battle
.      Bm7                        F#m
 God I know Your peace will meet me there

[b2]
.A       Bm7      F#m  D
 Oh, be still my heart
.   A        Bm7      F#m
 I know that You are God
.   D    E  F#m Bm7
 Oh fear no  evil
.        D   E       F#m
 For I know You are here</lyrics>
