  <lyrics>[1]
.A
 There's nothing worth more
.                    D
 That will ever come close  ||
.
 No thing can compare
.                  A
 You're our living hope
.              D
 Your Presence, Lord



[C]
.A
 Holy Spirit You are welcome here
.      D                              Bm
 Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere ||
.      A
 Your Glory God is what our hearts long for
.        D                Bm       A
 To be overcome by Your Presence Lord

---

[2]
 I've tasted and seen
 Of the sweetest of loves ||
 Where my heart becomes free
 And my shame is undone
 In Your Presence, Lord


[B]
.A
 Let us become more aware of Your Presence
.D                     Bm            E
 Let us experience the Glory of Your Goodness</lyrics>
