# OpensongFiles
Hello everyone

This is my personal database of song sheets that I have used for Christian worship over the years. I use these files in Opensong.
How to import to Opensong.
1. Download repository
2. Locate the directory where your Opensong song files are stored
3. Unzip the contents of the downloaded compressed folder into that directory
4. Launch Opensong; if everything went well, all of the songs should appear

I have pulled all of my chords/lyrics either from ultimateguitar.com, worshiptogther.com, or I listened to the songs on my own to write down the chords to the songs.

If there are any copyright issues with me posting this, please let me know immediately so I may take this down. I have no intention on taking anything away from the original publishers
