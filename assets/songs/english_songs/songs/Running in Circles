.          G                        C         
 I'm so forgetful, but You always remind me
.Em              G/B               C
 You're the only one who brings me peace
.Em              G/B               C
 You're the only one who brings me peace

 So I come, Lord I come 
.   D    G/B   C
 I come, Lord I come

.              G          
 To tell You I love You
.              C         
 To tell You I need You
.                    Em                 G/B        
 To tell You there's no better place for me ||
.             C
 Than in Your arms
.                G
 To tell You I'm sorry
.               C 
 For running in circles
.              Em            G/B                
 For placing my focus on the waves
.           C
 Not on Your face || 
.Em              G/B               C
 You're the only one who brings me peace
.Em              G/B               C
 You're the only one who brings me peace
