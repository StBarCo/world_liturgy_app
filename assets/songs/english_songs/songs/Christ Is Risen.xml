  <title>Christ Is Risen</title>
  <lyrics>[1]
.F#
 Let no one caught in sin remain
.B2
 Inside the lie of inward shame
.F#
 But fix our eyes upon the cross
.B2
 And run to Him who showed great love
.D#m          C# B2
 And bled for us
.D#m                  C#  B2
 Freely You’ve bled for us


[C]
.F#
 Christ is risen from the dead
.F#
 Trampling over death by death
.B2
 Come awake, come awake
.D#m                            C#
 Come and rise up from the grave
.F#
 Christ is risen from the dead
.F#
 We are one with Him again
.B2
 Come awake, come awake
.D#m                            C#
 Come and rise up from the grave

[2]
.F#
 Beneath the weight of all our sin
.B2
 You bowed to none but heaven’s will
.F#
 No scheme of hell, no scoffer's crown
.B2
 No burden great can hold You down
.D#m             C#   B2
 In strength You reign
.D#m                       C#    B2
 Forever let Your church proclaim


[B]
.F#        B2              D#m C#
 O death, where is your sting?
.F#        B2              D#m C#
 O hell, where is your victory?
.F#        B2              D#m    C#
 O church, come stand in the light
.F#        B2              D#m       C#
 The glory of God has defeated the night ||

[b2]
.F#        B2              D#m C#
 O death, where is your sting?
.F#        B2              D#m C#
 O hell, where is your victory?
.F#        B2              D#m    C#
 O church, come stand in the light
.F#            B2
 Our God is not dead
.D#m            C#
 He's alive! He's alive!</lyrics>
