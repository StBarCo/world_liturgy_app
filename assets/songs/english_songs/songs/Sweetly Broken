.G  D/F#  Em  C2


[1]
.             G
 To the cross I look
.             D/F#
 To the cross I cling
.                    Em
 Of it's suffering I do drink
.               C2
 Of it's work I do sing
.                G
 For on it my Savior
.              D/F#
 Both bruised and crushed
.                Em
 Showed that God is love
.           C2
 And God is just


[C]
.G
 At the cross You beckon me
.Em
 You draw me gently to my knees, and I am
.D/F#
 Lost for words, so lost in love, I'm
.C2                                 G  Em  D/F# C2
 Sweetly broken, wholly surrendered

.             G
 What a priceless gift
.       D/F#
 Undeserved life
.            Em
 Have I been given
.                    C2
 Through Christ crucified
.                      G
 You've called me out of death
.                      D/F#
 You've called me into life
.                      Em
 And I was under Your wrath
.                               C2
 Now through the cross I'm reconciled


[B]
.Em                            C2
 In awe of the cross I must confess
.Em
 How wondrous Your redeeming love and
.      C2                   D/F#
 How great is Your faithfulness</lyrics>
