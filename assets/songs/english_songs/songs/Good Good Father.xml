  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.G Gsus G Gsus

[1]
.G/B
 I've heard a thousand stories
.   Gsus
 Of what they think You're like ||
.G/B
 But I've heard the tender whisper
.   Gsus
 Of love in the dead of night  ||
.    C       G
 You tell me that Your pleased
.         Am7        D
 And that I'm never alone

[C]
.                    C
 You're a good, good Father
.                G               Am7
 It's who You are, it's who You are
.             D
 It's who You are ||
.                 C
 And I'm loved by You
.              G             Am7            D
 It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am

[B]
.C                              Em
 You are perfect in all of Your ways
.Am7                            G
 You are perfect in all of Your ways
.C                              Em       D
 You are perfect in all of Your ways to us

[2]
.G
 I've seen many searching
.    Gsus
 For answers far and wide ||
.G
 But I know we're all searching
.    Gsus
 For answers only You provide ||
.        C             G
 Because You know just what we need
.       Am7      D
 Before we say a word


[3]
.G
 Love so undeniable
.G
 I can hardly speak
.G
 Peace so unexplainable
.G
 I can hardly think ||
.       C       G/F#
 As You call me deeper still
.       Am7     G/F#
 As You call me deeper still
.       C       G/F#
 As You call me deeper still
.     Am7       D
 Into love love love</lyrics>
