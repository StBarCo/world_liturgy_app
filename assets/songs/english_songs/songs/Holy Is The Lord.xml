  <lyrics>[V]
.G            C           D
 We stand and lift up our hands
.        Em         C           D
 For the joy of the Lord is our strength ||
.G      C         D
 We bow down and worship Him now
.    Em        C          D
 How great how awesome is He


[P]
.                 A
 And together we sing 
.          C
 Everyone sing


[C]
.            G    C      D
 Holy is the Lord God Almighty
.    Em       C               D
 The earth is filled with His glory


[B]
.     G         D  
 It's rising up all around
.         F             C
 It's the anthem of the Lord's renown
.     G         D  
 It's rising up all around
.         F             C
 It's the anthem of the Lord's renown
