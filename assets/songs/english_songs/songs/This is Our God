.E                A
 A refuge for the poor
.                   E
 A shelter from the storm
.            A
 This is our God
.E                      A    
 He will wipe away your tears
.                   E
 Return your wasted years
.            A
 This is our God


[p]
.        F#m
 So call upon His Name
.      A         B             E
 He is mighty to save, this is our God


[c]
.A                       C#m 
 This is the one we have waited for
.A                       C#m 
 This is the one we have waited for
.A                       C#m 
 This is the one we have waited for
.A  E   C#m      E     A            E        
 Jesus, Lord and Savior, this is our God

.E               A
 A father to the orphan
.                E
 A healer to the broken
.            A
 This is our God
.E                      A
 He brings peace to our madness
.                   E
 And comfort in our sadness
.            A
 This is our God


[3]
.E                  A
 A fountain for the thirsty
.               E
 A lover for the lonely
.           A
 This is our God
.E                      A
 He brings glory to the humble
.                 E
 And crowns to the faithful
.           A
 This is our God</lyrics>
