  <lyrics>[Intro]
.Bm A/C# D A G


[1]
.Bm              A/C#     D              
 You call me out upon the waters        
.          A                      G
 The great unknown where feet may fail ||
.Bm                   A/C#   D         
 And there I find You in the mystery   
.          A                   G
 In oceans deep, my faith will stand


[C]
.G           D              A     
 And I will call upon Your name   
.G           D              A     
 And keep my eyes above the waves  ||
.            G
 When oceans rise    
.             D              A          
 My soul will rest in your embrace 
.         G          A       Bm
 For I am Yours, and You are mine ||

[2]
.Bm                    A/C#    D                      
 Your grace abounds in deepest waters  
.               A                G
 Your sovereign hand, will be my guide ||
.Bm                      A/C#      D                  
 Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me  
.             A                          G
 You've never failed and You won't start now

 Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
