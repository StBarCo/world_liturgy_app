[1]
.    G         D         A       Bm     G
 The sun comes up it's a new day dawning
.G            D         A      Bm
 It's time to sing Your song again ||
.    G        D
 Whatever may pass
.        A           Bm
 And whatever lies before me
.G2        D                Asus4   D
 Let me be singing when the evening comes

 Bless the Lord, O my soul
.A/C# Bm
 O my soul

 Worship His holy name ||

 Sing like never before

[2]
.       G       D               A       Bm
 You're rich in love and You're slow to anger
.G            D              A        B
 Your name is great and Your heart is kind
.G            D               A       Bm
 For all Your goodness I will keep on singing
.G            D              Asus  A  D
 Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find


[3]
.    G       D
 And on that day
.         A          Bm
 When my strength is failing
.G             D
 The end draws near
.       A        Bm
 And my time has come ||
.G        D
 Still my soul will sing
.     A        Bm
 Your praise unending
.G            D
 Ten thousand years
.        Asus  A  D
 And then forevermore</lyrics>
