.D                  G         D
 Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
.D                      A
 That saved a wretch like me
.  D        D/F#     G       D
 I once was lost but now I'm found
.    D         A7   D
 Was blind but now I see

[2]
.      D          D/F#      G         D
 'Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear
.    D                 A
 And Grace my fears relieved
.    D        D/F#     G       D
 How precious did that Grace appear
.    D        A7    D
 The hour I first believed

[C]
.D/F#          G                   D/F#
 My chains are gone, I've been set free
.   D/F#     G                  A
 My God, my Savior has ransomed me
.    D/F#   G               D/F#
 And like a flood His mercy rains
.         Em7  A7       D
 Unending love, Amazing Grace

.D                     G       D
 The Lord has promised good to me
.D                   A
 His word my hope secures
.  D        D/F#       G       D
 He will my shield and portion be
.   D       A7     D
 As long as life endures

[4]
.D                        G         D
 The earth shall soon dissolve like snow
.D                  A
 The sun forbear to shine
.    D       D/F#      G      D
 But God who called me here below
.     D     A7   D
 Will be forever mine
.     D     A7   D
 Will be forever mine
.     D     A7   D
 You are forever mine</lyrics>
