  <lyrics>[1]
.G        C    D   G/B
 Upon the hill  on Calvary
.G            C        D
 He came from Heaven's throne
.G   C          D          G/B
 Our fallenness  and mercy meet
.C               D     G
 Where blood and water flow

[2]
.G          C      D     G/B
 What grace divine, what selflessness
.G                 C        D                 
 That Christ would bear the weight
.G            C      D              G/B
 Our proof is scarred on hands that bled
.C                  D     G 
 That we were worth every nail


[C]
.            C                   G
 And all the praise and glory to God
.               Em            D
 We sing Hallelujah, sing Hallelujah
.        C                    G
 For the King has carried the cross
.      C     D        G
 He is risen from the grave

[3]
.G          C       D    G
 Beyond the tomb to holy skies
.G          C  D
 He rose in victory
.G               C      D     G
 And bridged for us the great divide
.C              D    G
 His life is our liberty


[B]
.          C
 It's Your love
.          G
 It's Your love 
.         D
 It's Your love 
.        Am
 That has saved me
.         C
 It's Your blood
.         G
 It's Your blood 
.         D
 It's Your blood
.        Am
 That has cleaned me
.C  G   D     Am
 Oh-Oh, Woah, Woah</lyrics>
