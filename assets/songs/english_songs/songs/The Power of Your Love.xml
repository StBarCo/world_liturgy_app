 Lord, I come to You, let my heart be changed, renewed,
.D                C                  D        Em    D
 Flowing from the grace, That I found in You ||

 Lord, I've come to know, The weaknesses I see in me
.D                 C  D                      C/G  G     
 Will be stripped away, By the power of Your love

 Bring me near, Draw me to Your side ||

 And as   I wait, I'll rise up like the eagle

 In the power of Your Love

 Lord unveil my eyes, Let me see You face to face
.D                C                  D        Em    D
 The knowledge of Your love, As You live in me ||
.G      D/F#    Em  
 Lord renew my mind
.                Bm     Em
 As Your will unfolds in my life

 In living every day, In the power of Your Love</lyrics>
