[1]
.       A
 praise God from whom all blessings flow
.                                E
 praise Him all creatures here below
.       A
 praise Him above ye Heavenly Host
.                      E    A
 praise Father Son and Holy Ghost

[2]
.       A
 praise God the uncreated One
.                            E
 who sent His Son to die for us
.    A
 defeated death He took our sin
.                        E     A
 our praise for Him will never end

.       A
 praise God and let His kingdom reign
.                           E

 His Spirit with us three in one
.                      E      A
 Praise God the Father Spirit Son</lyrics>
