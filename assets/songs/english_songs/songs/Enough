 You are my supply

 My breath of life
.           Bm7             E
 Still more awesome than I know
.A           D           E
 You are my reward

 Worth living for

 Still more awesome than I know

.           A          D                E               D
 All of You is more than enough for
.          A        D              E                D       A
 All of me for every thirst and every need
.  D                 E            D          A
 You satisfy me with Your love

 You√Ωre my coming King
 You are everything
 Still more awesome than I know
