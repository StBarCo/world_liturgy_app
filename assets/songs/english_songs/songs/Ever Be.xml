.D                   Em                     G
 Your love is devoted, like a ring of solid gold
.                        F#m      A            D
 Like a vow that is tested, like a covenant of old ||
.                    Em                   G
 Your love is enduring, through the winter rain
.                    F#m     A               G
 and beyond the horizon, with mercy for today

[P1]
.G                 D                           A
 Faithful You have been, and faithful You will be
.                      Em
 You pledge yourself to me, and it’s why I sing

[C]
.     G                         D
 Your praise will ever be on my lips
.
 Ever be on my lips ||
.     Bm                        A
 Your praise will ever be on my lips
.
 Ever be on my lips

 You Father the orphan
.Em                       G
 Your kindness makes us whole
.                         F#m
 You shoulder our weakness,
.         A
 and Your strength becomes our own ||
.D                       
 You’re making me like You
.Em               G
 clothing me in white
.                          F#m
 Bringing beauty from ashes
.    A
 For You will have Your bride


[P2]
.G               D                         A
 Free of all her guilt, and rid of all her shame
.                     Em
 And known by her true name, and it’s why I sing

 With angels and saints

 You will be praised, You will be praised

 With angels and saints

 We sing worthy are You Lord </lyrics>
