  <lyrics>[1]
.G
 I see the King of glory
.Em
 Coming on the clouds with fire ||
.                Am
 The whole earth shakes
.                D 
 The whole earth shakes 

[2]
 I see His love and mercy
 Washing over all our sin ||
 The people sing
 The people sing


[C]
.  G   C    D   Em
 Hosanna, Hosanna
.  C           Em    D/F#
 Hosanna in the Highest ||
.  G   C    D   Em
 Hosanna, Hosanna
.C              D     Em
 Hosanna in the Highest
---

[3]
 I see a generation
 Rising up to take their place ||
 With selfless faith, with selfless faith

[4]
 I see a near revival
 Staring as we pray and seek ||
 We're on our knees, we're on our knees


[Instrumental]
.Em G Am7 Bm7


[B]
.C                         D
 Heal my heart and make it clean
.G                      Em
 Open up my eyes to the things unseen
.C                        D             Em
 Show me how to love like You have loved me ||
.C                               D
 Break my heart for what breaks Yours
.G                        Em  
 Everything I am for Your Kingdom's cause
.C                      D         C
 As I walk from earth into eternity</lyrics>
