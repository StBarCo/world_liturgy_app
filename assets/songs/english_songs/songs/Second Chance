.G C G C


[1]
.G
 You called my name, reached out Your hand
.C                               Am7
 Restored my life, and I was redeemed
.                           D
 The moment You entered my life


[2] 
.G
 Amazing grace, Christ gave that day
.C                                Am7
 My life was changed when from my shoulders
.                      D
 Fell the weight of my sin


[C]
.                          G
 So it’s with everything I am
.                     D
 I reach out for Your hand
.               Em7 
 The hope for change 
.                         C
 The second chance I’ve gained   
.                  G  
 On You I throw my life
.                      D
 Casting all my fears aside
.                            Em7
 How could greater love than this
.               C
 Ever possibly exist

[3]
.G
 Consume my thoughts 
.              C
 As I rest in You
.                       Am7
 I’m now in love with a Saviour
.   Am7                      C
 Bearing the marks of His love


[Interlude]
.Am7 D


[B]
.        G
 So I’ll wait upon You now
.        D
 With my hands released to You
.        Em7
 Where a little faith’s enough
.       C
 To see mountains lift and move
.         G
 And I’ll wait upon You now
.    D
 Dedicated to Your will
.        Em7
 To this love that will remain
.  C
 A love that never fails</lyrics>
