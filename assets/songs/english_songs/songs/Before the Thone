  <lyrics>[1]
.           C         F    C
 Before the throne of God above
.         C                 Em
 I have a strong, a perfect plea 
.             F       C      G     Am
 A great High Priest, whose name is Love
.         F                    C
 Who ever lives and pleads for me ||
.           F             C
 My name is graven on his hands
.           F              Am    
 My name is written on his heart ||
.            F        G         Am 
 I know that while in heaven he stands 
.              F             Am
 No tongue can bid me thence depart 
.              F             G C 
 No tongue can bid me thence depart

[2]
.           C         F    C    
 When Satan tempts me to despair
.             C            Em
 And tells me of the guilt within 
.         F     C   G       Am
 Upward I look, and see him there
.            F             C
 Who made an end of all my sin ||
.          F              C 
 Because a sinless Savior died
.          F               Am
 My sinful soul is counted free ||
.             F        G   Am
 For God, the Just, is satisfied
.           F              C
 To look on Him and pardon me
.           F              C
 To look on Him and pardon me

[T]
.     G           Em Am             F
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Praise the One
.      G      C
 Risen Son of God


[3]
.           C          F     C    
 Behold him there, the risen Lamb
.            C                 Em
 My perfect, spotless righteousness, 
.            F   C  G     Am
 The great unchangeable I am,
.            F            C
 The King of glory and of grace! ||
.          F              C 
 One in himself, I cannot die
.           F                Am
 My soul is purchased by his blood ||
.           F        G         Am
 My life is hid with Christ on high,
.                F             C
 With Christ, my Savior and my God
.                F          G  C
 With Christ, my Savior and my God</lyrics>
