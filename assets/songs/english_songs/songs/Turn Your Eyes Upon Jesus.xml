  <lyrics>[1]
.  C            G         Am  C 
 O soul are you weary and troubled
.   F            Dm           C    G
 No light in the darkness you see
.        C           C7          F  Fm
 There's light for a look at the Saviour
.   C         G            C
 And life more abundant and free 


[C] 
.C         G7        Am C
 Turn your eyes upon Je-sus, 
.     F           Dm        G7
 Look full in His wonderful face 
.        C         C7              F         Fm
 And the things of earth will grow strangely dim 
.       C            G         C
 In the light of His glory and grace.

.C                  G         Am C 
 Through death into life everlasting 
.   F              Dm         C     G
 He passed, and we follow Him there 
.     C      C7           F    Fm
 Over us sin no more hath dominion 
.    C         G             C
 For more than conquerors we are

.C                  G            Am C
 His Word shall not fail you, He promised 
.  F             Dm          C     G     
 Believe Him and all will be well 
.     C       C7            F Fm 
 Then go to a world that is dying 
.    C       G            C
 His perfect salvation to tell </lyrics>
