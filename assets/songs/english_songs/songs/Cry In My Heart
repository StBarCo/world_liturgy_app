  <title>Cry In My Heart</title>
  <lyrics>[V]
.G
 There's a cry in my heart
.D            Dsus2
 For your glory to fall
.Am                              Dsus4 D
 For Your presence to fill up my senses
.G
 There's a yearning again
.D
 A thirst for discipline
.Am                           Dsus4 D
 A hunger for things that are deeper
.Em                   C 
 Could You take me beyond
.G                    D/F#
 Could You carry me through
.Em               C
 If I opened my heart
.Dsus4                  D  
 Could I go there with You

.               C
 For what do I have
.                      G
 If I don't have You Jesus
.              D/F#
 What in this life
.              Em
 Could mean anymore
.             C
 You are my rock
.             G
 You are my glory
.             D/F#    C     Em
 You are the lifter of my head


[B]
.Em                   C
 For I've been here before
.G                        D/F#
 Yet I know there's still more
.Am                sus4  D  
 O Lord, I need to know You</lyrics>
