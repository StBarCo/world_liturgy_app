  <lyrics>[1]
.G
 Grace, what have you done?
.Em            C         G
 Murdered for me on that cross
.  G
 Accused in absence of wrong
.  Em              C        G
 My sin washed away in Your blood


[P1]
.    Bm           C           G
 Too much to make sense of it all
.  Bm              C             G
 I know that Your love breaks my fall
.    D                     Em
 The scandal of grace, You died in my place
.      C
 So my soul will live


[C]
.         G
 Oh to be like You
.                         D
 Give all I have just to know You
.                        C
 Jesus there's no one beside You
.                       G    C Em C
 Forever the Hope in my heart

[2]
.G
 Death, where is your sting?
.     Em           C         G
 Your power is as dead as my sin
.    G
 The Cross has taught me to live
.    Em        C                G
 And mercy, my heart now to sing


[P2]
.    Bm          C                  G
 The day and its troubles shall come
.  Bm              C               G
 I know that Your strength is enough
.    D                     Em
 The scandal of grace, You died in my place
.      C
 So my soul will live


[B]
.(F)      G
 And it's all because of You, Jesus
.     D
 It's all because of You, Jesus
.     Em
 It's all because of Your love
.       C
 And my soul will live</lyrics>
