  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.E B F#m E B A

[1]
.E            B
 Light of the world
.            F#m
 You stepped down into darkness
.E         B           A
 Opened my eyes let me see ||
.E           B         F#m
 Beauty that made this heart adore You
.E         B               A
 Hope of a life spent with You


[C]
.             E
 Here I am to worship
.             B
 Here I am to bow down
.             E/G#               A
 Here I am to say that You're my God ||
.                  E
 You're altogether lovely
.           B
 Altogether worthy
.           E/G#         A
 Altogether wonderful to me

[2]
.E           B         F#m
 King of all days O so highly exalted
.E           B       A
 Glorious in Heaven above ||
.E          B           F#m
 Humbly You came to the earth You created
.E              B          A
 All for love's sake became poor


[B]
.     B          E           A
 I'll never know how much it costs
.   B      E    A
 To see my sin up on that Cross


[t]
.E                         B
 Call upon the Name of the Lord
.       C#m  A
 And be saved</lyrics>
