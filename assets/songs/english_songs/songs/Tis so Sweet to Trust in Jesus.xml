  <lyrics>[1]
.G                 C       G
 Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus
.                C       D
 And to take him at His word
.G              C        G
 Just to rest upon His promise
.         C         Dsus  D    G
 And to know, "Thus saith the Lord."

.G             C      D
 Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him
.G                  C        D
 How I've proved him o'er and o'er
.G              C       G
 Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus
.       C        D        G
 O for grace to trust Him more

.G                 C       G
 O how sweet to trust in Jesus
.                C       D
 Just to trust his cleansing blood
.G              C        G
 And in simple faith to plunge me
.         C         Dsus  D    G
 Beneath the healing, cleansing flood

.G                   C       G
 Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus
.                  C       D
 Just from sin and self to cease
.G               C        G
 Just from Jesus simply taking
.         C         Dsus  D    G
 Life and rest, and joy and peace

.G              C            G
 I'm so glad I learned to trust thee
.                C       D
 Precious Jesus, Savior, friend
.G               C        G
 And I know that thou art with me
.         C         Dsus  D    G
 Wilt be with me to the end</lyrics>
