  <lyrics>[1]
.C      Am7               F2
 I was lost, I was in chains
.                Gsus2    G  C
 The world had a hold of me
.C                Am7                    F2
 My heart was a stone, I was covered in shame
.        G
 When He came for me


[P]
.C                        Am7
 I couldn't run, couldn't run from His presence
.F2                       G
 I couldn't run, couldn't run from His arms


[C]
.C          Am7
 Jesus, He loves me
.    F2             G
 He loves me, He is for me
.C          Am7
 Jesus, how can it be
.   F2              G     (C)
 He loves me, He is for me

.C        Am7               F2
 It was a fire, deep in my soul
.           Gsus2   G
 I'll never be the same
.C                   Am7             F2
 I stepped out of the dark, into the light
.        Gsus2     G
 When he called my name


[B]
.Am7                        F                          
 He holds the stars, and He holds my heart
.C                        G/B
 With healing hands, that bear the scars
.Am7                        F
 The rugged Cross, where He died for me
.C                G
 My only hope, my everything
