  <lyrics>[1]
.                A
 Old things have passed away
.              E2
 Your love has stayed the same
.              A                         E2
 Your constant grace remains the cornerstone ||
.               A
 Things that we thought were dead
.                 E2
 Are breathing in life again
.               A                        E2
 You cause Your Son to shine on darkest nights
