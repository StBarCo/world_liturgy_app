 As we all bow down

 As we all come casting off our crowns

 Would You hear our cry 
.            G      A     D   D2  G  D  D2  G 
 We want to see You glorified 

[C]
.     G   A    D         G    A  D/F# 
 Glorify Your name, Glorify Your name 
.     G   A    Bm        G        A          D 
 Glorify Your name, We want to see You glorified

 As we join as one    
 As we live to let Your Kingdom come 
 Father through our lives 
 We want to see You glorified

 Like water o'er the sea, Filled with glory
