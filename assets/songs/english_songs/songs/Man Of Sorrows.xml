[1]
.D              G       D
 Man of sorrows Lamb of God
.G      D   A
 By His own betrayed
.Bm                 G        Bm
 The sin of man and wrath of God
.    G       A     D
 Has been on Jesus laid


[C]
.        Bm     G        D    A
 Oh that rugged cross my salvation
.           Bm          G       A
 Where Your love poured out over me ||
.       G         D         A   Bm
 Now my soul cries out Hallelujah 
.           G      A   D
 Praise and honour unto Thee


[B]
.       Bm      G          D       A
 Now my debt is paid it is paid in full
.       Bm       G             D     A
 By the precious blood that my Jesus spilled ||
.       Bm        G          D       A
 Now the curse of sin has no hold on me
.         Bm       G          D      A
 Whom the Son sets free, oh is free indeed
---
[2]
.D            G     D
 Silent as He stood accused
.G      D          A
 Beaten mocked and scorned
.Bm            G        Bm
 Bowing to the Father's will
.   G      A        D
 He took a crown of thorns


[3]
.D              G         D
 Sent of heaven God's own Son
.   G        D     A
 To purchase and redeem
.    Bm            G    Bm
 And reconcile the very ones
.    G          A       D
 Who nailed Him to that tree


[4]
.D                G       D
 See the stone is rolled away
.  G         D    A
 Behold the empty tomb
.Bm         G      Bm
 Hallelujah God be praised
.     G     A       D
 He's risen from the grave
