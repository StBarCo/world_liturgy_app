  <lyrics>[1]
.G               C          
 Worthy of every song we could ever sing
.G                 C
 Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring
.G               C
 Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
.            Em    C
 We live for You


[C]
.C                    Am
 Holy there is no one like You
.              G
 There is none beside You
.           Em
 Open up my eyes in wonder ||
.C
 Show me who You are
.    Am
 And fill me with Your heart
.    G
 And lead me in Your love
.     Em
 To those around me


[B]
.C               D               Em
 I will build my life, upon Your love
.        G
 It is a firm foundation
.C             D                Em
 I will put my trust, in You oh lord
.           G
 And I will not be shaken

.G            C    
 Jesus a name above every other name
.G              C
 Jesus the only one that could ever save
.G               C
 Worthy of every breathe we could ever breathe
.            Em
 We live for You
.            C
 We live for You
