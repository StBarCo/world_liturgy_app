.G C
;Capo 3
[V1]
.G                         C               G
 Come out of sadness, from wherever you've been
.C           G            D      
 Come broken hearted, Let rescue begin ||
.Em             G          C          G
 Come find your mercy, Oh sinner come kneel
.C            G           D            Em
 Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't heal
.C            G           D            G
 Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't heal

[C]
.                 C                      G
 So lay down your burdens, lay down your shame
.            C                    D
 All who are broken, lift up your face ||
.            C                        Em
 Oh wanderer come home, you're not too far
.                 C                   D
 So lay down your hurt, lay down your heart,
.            Em
 Come as you are
---



[V2]
.G                                  
 There's hope for the hopeless
.    C                G
 and all those who've strayed
.C               G           D            G
 Come sit at the table, Come taste of the grace ||
.        Em             G     C        G
 There's rest for the weary, rest that endures
.C            G           D            G
 Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't cure

[B]
.            C
 Come as you are
.            Em
 Fall in his arms
.            D
 Come as you are

[V3]
.G                            C            G
 There's joy for the morning, Oh sinner be still
.C            G           D            Em
 Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't heal
.C            G           D            G
 Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't heal
