  <lyrics>[1]
.D          A              Bm                    G        D
 I once was lost in darkest night, yet thought I knew the way ||
.             Em       D/F#    G               A      D
 The sin that promised joy and life had led me to the grave ||
.         D                   Bm          G       D
 I had no hope that You would own a rebel to Your will ||
.           Bm                               G        A
 And if You had not loved me first I would refuse You still

[2]
.D         A                Bm                G        D
 But as I ran my hell-bound race, indifferent to the cost ||
.             Em      D/F#    G                A      D
 You looked upon my helpless state, and led me to the cross ||
.         D                   Bm                G     D
 And I beheld Godâ€™s love displayed You suffered in my place ||
.             Bm                               G       A
 You bore the wrath reserved for me, now all I know is grace

[C]
.    D    G    D          A       Bm
 Hal-le - lu - jah! All I have is Christ ||
.         G    Bm         A     D
 Hal-le - lu - jah! Jesus is my life

[3]
.D          A                Bm                 G        D
 Now, Lord, I would be Yours alone, and live so all might see  ||
.                Em     D/F#    G                 A         D
 The strength to follow Your commands,could never come from me ||
.          D               Bm           G       D
 Oh Father use my ransomed life, in any way You choose. ||
.           Bm                       G        A
 And let my song forever be, my only boast is You
