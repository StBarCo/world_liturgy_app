  <lyrics>[1]
.G         C      D          G                 
 Above all powers, above all kings
.          C           D           G  
 Above all nature, and all created things ||
.          Em          D               C  G
 Above all wisdom, and all the ways of man 
.Am            C                D     
 You were here before the world began


[2]
.          C        D          G
 Above all kingdoms, above all thrones
.          C            D              G       
 Above all wonders this world has ever known ||
.          Em         D                C   G
 Above all wealth and treasures of the earth
.Am                C                   Em
 There's no way to measure what you're worth


[C]
.G     Am   D             G
 Crucified, laid behind a stone
.G            Am     D          G               
 You lived to die, rejected and alone ||
.       Em    D               C    G
 Like a rose, trampled on the ground
.             Am   Em              C  D              
 You took the fall, and thought of me 
.      G
 Above all
