  <lyrics>[1]
.            C/E                F
 Oh heart of mine, why must you stray
.            Am           F
 From one so fair you run away 
.             C/E  E7          Am   F
 And one more time you have to pay
.      C/E    F            C/E
 The heaviness of needless shame


[C]
.        F            G
 So come home running
.             C
 His arms are open wide
.            F     G
 His name is Jesus
.        C
 He understands ||
.          F      G
 He is the answer
.        Am
 You are looking for
.G         F     G
 So come home running
.            C
 Just as you are

.            C/E             F
 Oh heart of mine, come back home
.                Am               F
 You've been too long out on your own 
.              C/E  E7   Am    F
 And He's been there all along
.        C/E  F            C/E 
 Watching for you down the road


[3]
.            C/E           F
 Oh child of God so dearly loved
.             Am              F
 And ransomed by the Savior's blood 
.             C/E   E7          Am   F
 And called by name, Daughter and Son
.              C/E  F           C/E
 Wrapped in the robe of righteousness</lyrics>
