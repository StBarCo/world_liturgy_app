.Em    C2       G   D         Em  C   G           D
 Love unfailing, overtaking my heart, You take me in

 Finding peace again, fear is lost, in all You are

 And I would give the world to tell Your story

 Cause I know that You've called me

 I know that You've called me ||
.D                                    C2
 I've lost myself for good within Your promise
.            Em
 And I won't hide it
.        C2
 I won't hide it


[C]

 Jesus I believe in You, and I would go

 To the ends of the earth ||

 For You alone are the Son of God

 That You are God

 That You are God</lyrics>
