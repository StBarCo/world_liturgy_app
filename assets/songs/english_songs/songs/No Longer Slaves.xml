  <lyrics>[Intro]
.Em D G C

[1]
.G
 You unravel me, with a melody
.C               D         G
 You surround me with a song ||
.G
 Of deliverance, from my enemies
.     C       D         G
 Till all my fears are gone


[C]
.       C        D        G
 I’m no longer a slave to fear
.  Em   D        G
 I am a child of God

[2]
.                G
 From my Mothers womb
.           Bm
 You have chosen me
.C        D         G
 Love has called my name ||
.          G                     Bm
 I’ve been born again, into Your family
.     C           D               G
 Your blood flows through my veins


[Interlude]
.Em D G C


[B]
.Em            D              G          C
 You split the sea so I could walk right through it
.Em           D                  G
 My fears are drowned in perfect love
.Em          D             G         Bm
 You rescued me and I will stand and sing
. Em    D        G
 I am a child of God</lyrics>
