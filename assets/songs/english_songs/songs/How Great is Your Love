  <lyrics>[1]
.         E
 From the darkness I called Your Name
.     B
 Into darkness Your mercy came
.              A             C#m
 You called me out Lifted me up
.                  B
 How great is Your love

.            E
 You bore my weakness You took my shame
.          B
 Buried my burdens in fields of grace
.               A            C#m
 You called me out lifted me up
.                  B
 How great is Your love

[P]
.E
 From the heights of Heaven
.
 You stepped down to earth
.B
 Innocent perfection, gave Your life for us ||
.A              C#m
 We are amazed, We stand in awe
.    B
 For we have been changed
.
 By the power of the Cross

 In Your kindness You lead me home

 In Your presence where I belong
