.C          G               C
 Precious compassion that pours 
.           C/E             F             C G 
 From the wounds that have won our salvation 
.F       C              Am           G 
 Sin was strong but the Savior is stronger 
.F           G       C 
 Come let us worship Him 
 
 
[C]
.          F                    C 
 Raised to life with Christ the Savior 
.       F            Am     C
 In His Name a new creation now
.    F         G 
 Our song will rise

 Adoring Christ the Lord

 Sin was strong

 Our shame was great

 But Jesus You're greater

.C             G            C    
 Great was the debt that we owed 
.        C            F            C  G
 And how high was the price of our healing 
.F       C           Am         G
 Paid in full by the One who is worthy 
.F           G       C
 Come let us worship Him 
 
 
 
[3]
.C         G           C
 Death overcome by the Word
.          C        F          C   G 
 That was spoken before it was finished
.F     C            Am       G 
 Jesus saves is our song everlasting 
.F           G       C
 Come let us worship Him
