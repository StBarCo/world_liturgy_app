  <lyrics>[1]
.G             
 After the pride
.Gsus       G
 After the fall
.             C     Em     D
 The hands of mercy opened wide
.          G              
 After the rain
.Gsus      G
 After the flood
.             C       Em     D
 You set Your promise in the sky


[P]
.    C               Em    Dsus
 The God who was and is to come
.    C        Em       Dsus
 Has been the same for me


[C]
.Gsus            G
 After all these years
.Gsus            G
 You’ve never given up
.      Em
 After all these years
.
 You’re constant with Your love
.     C             Em         D
 It amazes me after all You’ve done
.     C                     Em            D
 It amazes me, You’re still running after us

.G              Gsus
 After the cross
.G              Gsus
 After the shame
.            C          Em   D
 No power of hell could ever take
.             Gsus
 Your perfect life
.Gsus         G
 Your gift of grace
.          C      Em       D
 That testifies beyond the grave
.           C      Em       D
 Still testifies beyond the grave


[P2]
.    C               Em    Dsus
 The God who was and is to come
.    C        Em       Dsus
 Has been the same for me
.              C        Em      D
 You’ve always been the same for me
