  <lyrics>[1]
.              D                A
 How great the chasm that lay between us
.             G       Bm           A
 How high the mountain I could not climb
.        D                  A
 In desperation I turned to heaven
.               G      A      D
 And spoke Your name into the night
.                 G                    D
 Then through the darkness Your loving kindness
.                 Bm            A
 Tore through the shadows of my soul
.            D                   A
 The work is finished the end is written
.      G         A      D
 Jesus Christ my Living Hope


[C]
.     G D              A              Bm
 Hallelujah praise the One who set me free
.     G D             A                Bm
 Hallelujah death has lost its grip on me
.         G            D             
 You have broken every chain
.           A              Bm
 There’s salvation in Your Name
.      G         A      D
 Jesus Christ my Living Hope

[2]
.           D                 A
 Who could imagine so great a mercy
.                 G     Bm              A
 What heart could fathom such boundless grace
.           D                      A
 The God of Ages stepped down from Glory
.           G       A       D
 To wear my sin and bear my shame
.               G             D
 The cross has spoken I am forgiven
.            Bm                 A
 The King of Kings calls me His own
.          D                   A
 Beautiful Savior I’m Yours forever
.      G         A      D
 Jesus Christ my Living Hope


[3]
.              D                       A
 Then came the morning that sealed the promise
.            G    Bm          A
 Your buried body    began to breathe
.           D                   A
 Out of the silence the Roaring Lion
.             G            A        D
 Declared the grave has no claim on me
