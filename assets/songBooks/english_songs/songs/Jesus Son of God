[1]
.B                  E
 You came down from heaven's throne
.      F#5                 E
 This earth You formed was not Your home
.  G#m                 E               B
 A love like this, the world had never known
.  B                  E
 A crown of thorns to mock Your name
.   F#5            E
 Forgiveness fell upon Your face
.  G#m                 E                  B
 A love like this, the world had never known


[C]
.       B
 On the altar of our praise
.          F#           B
 Let there be no higher name
. E    B     F#
 Jesus Son of God
.         G#m
 You laid down Your perfect life
.    F#           B
 You are the sacrifice
. E    B      F#
 Jesus Son of God
.         E    B     F#
 You are Jesus Son of God

.     B                 E
 You took our sin, You bore our shame

 You rose to life, You defeated the grave
.   G#m                 E                  B
 A love like this, the world has never known
.     B                C#m7
 You took our sin, You bore our shame
.     F#5                 E
 You rose to life, You defeated the grave
.   G#m                 E                  B
 A love like this, the world has never known



[B]
.           E                     B   F#
 Be lifted higher than all You've overcome
.             E               B     F#
 Your name be louder than any other song
.            E              B                 F#
 There is no power that can come against Your love
.     E         B
 The cross was enough
.    G#m        F#
 The cross was enough
.     E        B
 The cross was enough
.    G#m       F#   
 The cross was enough</lyrics>
