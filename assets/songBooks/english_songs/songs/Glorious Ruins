[1]                                
.         E                
 When the mountains fall
.                B
 And the tempest roars
.        C#m     A
 You are with me
.        E                     
 When creation falls
.                   B
 Still my soul will soar
.        C#m
 On Your mercy


[P]
.      A                   
 I'll walk through the fire
.         E
 With my head lifted high
.         C#m                     B
 And my spirit revived, in Your story
.       A              
 I'll look to the cross
.       C#m
 As my failure is lost
.          E                     B 
 In the light of Your glorious grace

[2]
.         E
 When the world caves in
.                     B
 Still my hope will cling
.         C#m    A
 To Your promise
.        E
 When my courage ends
.                   B
 Let my heart find strength
.         C#m
 In Your presence


[C]
.                       E
 Let the ruins come to life
.                       A
 In the beauty of Your name
.                    E
 Rising up from the ashes
.                 B
 God forever You reign
.                       C#m
 And my soul will find refuge
.                       A
 In the shadow of Your wings
.                   E
 I will love You forever
.                  B
 And forever I'll sing
