Man of Sorrows, what a name!
For the Son of God, Who came
.A D/A A E F#m D A
Ruined sinners to reclaim. 
Hallelujah! What a Savior!
[2]
Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
In my place condemned He stood;
Sealed my pardon with His blood.
Hallelujah! What a Savior!
[3]
Guilty, vile, and helpless we;
Spotless Lamb of God was He;
Full atonement! Can it be?
Hallelujah! What a Savior!
[4]
Now in heaven exalted high. 
Hallelujah! What a Savior!
Lifted up was He to die;
"It is finished!" was His cry;

[5]
When He comes, our glorious King,
All His ransomed home to bring,
Then anew His song weâ€™ll sing:
Hallelujah! What a Savior!</lyrics></song>
