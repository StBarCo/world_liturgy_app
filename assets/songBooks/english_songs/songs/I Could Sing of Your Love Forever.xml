  <title>I Could Sing of Your Love Forever</title>
  <lyrics>[V]
.G                           Em
 Over the mountains and the sea
.                              C
 Your river runs with love for me
.                      D
 and I will open up my heart
.                          G
 and let the Healer set me free ||
.                       Em
 I'm happy to be in the truth
.                         C
 and I will daily lift my hands
.                          D
 for I will always sing of when
.
 Your love came down


[C]
.G                    D
 I could sing of Your love forever
.Em                   C
 I could sing of Your love forever


[B]
.Am                   G
   Oh, I feel like dancing - hey yeaah
.Am                      G
   it's foolishness I know ||
.Am                           G
   but when the world has seen the light
.          C          G
 they will dance with joy
.           C       D
 like we're dancing now</lyrics>
