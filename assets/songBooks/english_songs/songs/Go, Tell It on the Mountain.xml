  <title>Go, Tell It on the Mountain</title>
  <lyrics>

[B]Refrain:
  Go, tell it on the mountain,
  Over the hills and ev'rywhere; 
  Go, tell it on the mountain
  That Jesus Christ is born.

[1] While shepherds kept their watching
O'er silent flocks by night,
Behold, throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light. 
[B]  [Refrain]

[2] The shepherds feared and trembled
When high above the earth
Rang out the angel chorus
That hailed our Savior's birth. 
[B]  [Refrain]

[3] And lo, when they had heard it,
They all bowed down and prayed;
They traveled on together
To where the Babe was laid. 
[B]  [Refrain]

[4] Down in a lowly manger
The humble Christ was born,
And God sent us salvation
That blessed Christmas morn. 
[B]  [Refrain]
