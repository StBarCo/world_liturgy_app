.G C

[1]
.G
 Who breaks the power of sin and darkness
.C
 Whose love is mighty and so much stronger    
.Em                D                         C
 The King of Glory, the King above all kings    ||
.G
 Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder
.C
 Who leaves us breathless in awe and wonder    
.Em                D                        C
 The King of Glory, the King above all kings


[C]
.                G
 This is amazing grace
.                  C
 This is unfailing love    
.                       Em
 That You would take my place
.                        D
 That You would bear my cross    ||
.                        G
 You would lay down Your life
.                    C
 That I would be set free    
.  Em
 Oh, Jesus, I sing for
.D                           G C
  All that You've done for me


[B]
.G(Em)
 Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
.C
 Worthy is the King who conquered the grave

.G
  Who brings our chaos back into order
.C
  Who makes the orphan a son and daughter  
.Em                D
  The King of Glory, the King above all kings ||
.G
  Who rules the nations with truth and justice
.C
  Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance 
.Em                 D                        C
  The King of Glory, the King above all kings


[T]
.G
 What other king leaves His throne
.C
 What other king leaves His throne
.Em
 What other king leaves His Glory
.                                 C
 His glory to die, His glory to die
