.F G Am Em
.F G Am Em


[1]
.F              G                      Am
   I tasted the world, seen more than enough
.    Em
 Its promises fleeting
.F              G                   Am
   Of water and wine, I emptied the cup
.      Em
 And found myself wanting
.F                G                  Am | G
   But there is a well that never runs dry
.F              G                     Am
   The water of life, the blood of the vine


[C]
.G     C
 All I know is
.G                        Am
 Everything I have means nothing
.F                      C
 Jesus if You're not my one thing
.G                        Am
 Everything I need right now
.                       (F)
 All I need is You right now

[2]
.F                  G                   Am
   Just one thing I ask and this I will seek
.   Em
 If only to know You
.F                 G                    Am
   To be where You are and go where You lead
.     G
 My God, I will follow
.F                    G                    Am | G
   The things of this world I've counted as loss
.F              G                   Am
   I lay it all down to take up this cross


[C2]
.       G     C
 'Cause all I know is
.    G                      Am
 E - verything I have means nothing
.     F                    C
 Je - sus if you're not my one thing
.     G                     Am | F
 E - verything I need right now
.             C
 'Cause all I want is
.    G                     Am
 E - verything You are and nothing
.     F                    C
 Je - sus if You're not my one thing
.    G                     Am | F
 E - verything to me right now


[B]
.
 And I'll sing
.C  |  G
 Woah
.Am  |  F
 Woah
.         C              G
 I want nothing but to know You
.        Am               F
 And to be with You, my God
.
 And I'll sing
.C  |  G
 Woah
.Am  |  F
 Woah
.           C               G
 And with everything within me
.         Am               F
 I will worship You, my God</lyrics>
