  <title>One Thing Remains</title>
  <lyrics>[1]
.CM9             G                Dsus
 Higher than the mountains that I face
.CM9               G            Dsus
 Stronger than the power of the grave ||
.CM9             G             Dsus
 Constant in the trial and the change
.    C    G  Dsus
 One thing remains
.    C    G  Dsus
 One thing remains


[C]
.     Em7               Cadd9
 Your love never fails, never gives up
.G                 Dsus
 Never runs out on me

[2]
.CM9           G            Dsus
 On and on and on and on it goes
.CM9               G            Dsus
 It overwhelms and satisfies my soul ||
.      CM9        G          Dsus
 And I never ever have to be afraid
.    CM9  G  Dsus
 One thing remains


[B]
.   CM9       G         D
 In death, in life, I’m confident and
.Am7            CM9      G          D
 covered by the power of Your great love ||
.   CM9     G             D
 My debt is paid, there’s nothing that can
.Am7         CM9        G/B        D
 Separate my heart from Your great love</lyrics>
