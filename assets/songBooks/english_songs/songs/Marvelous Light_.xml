  <title>Marvelous Light </title>
  <lyrics>[1]
.B
 I once was fatherless
.E
 A stranger with no hope
.B
 Your kindness wakened me,
.E
 Wakened me from my sleep ||
.B
 Your love it beckons deeply
.E
 A call to come and die
.B
 By grace now I will come
.E
 Take this life, take Your life


[P]
.G#m     F#
 Sin has lost its power
.E
 Death has lost its sting
.G#m       F#               E
 From the grave You've risen victoriously


[C]
.B
 Into marvelous light I'm running
.E
 Out of darkness out of shame
.G#m              F#
 By the cross You are the truth
.    E
 You are the life You are the Way

---

[2]
.B
 My dead heart now is beating
.E
 My deepest stains now clean
.B
 Your breath fills up my lungs
.E
 Now I'm free, now I'm free


[B]
.B
 Lift my hands and spin around
.E
 See the light that I have found
.G#m    F#                   E
 Oh the marvelous light, the marvelous light</lyrics>
