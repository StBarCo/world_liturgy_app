  <title>Since Jesus Came into My Heart</title>
  <lyrics>

[1]
What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought
since Jesus came into my heart!
I have light in my soul for which long I had sought,
since Jesus came into my heart!

[C]
Refrain:
  Since Jesus came into my heart,
  since Jesus came into my heart,
  floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll,
  since Jesus came into my heart.

[2]
I'm possessed of a hope that is steadfast and sure,
since Jesus came into my heart!
And no dark clouds of doubt now my pathway obscure,
since Jesus came into my heart! [Refrain]

[3]
There's a light in the valley of death now for me,
since Jesus came into my heart!
And the gates of the city beyond I can see,
since Jesus came into my heart! [Refrain]

[4]
I shall go there to dwell in that city, I know,
since Jesus came into my heart!
And I'm happy, so happy, as onward I go,
since Jesus came into my heart! [Refrain]
