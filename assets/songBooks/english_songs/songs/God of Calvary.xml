.C G/B Am F

[1]
.C                                    G/B     Am
 On the hill of Calvary, the Light of all the world
.                      F
 With the world on His shoulders
.C
 The weight of all our shame
.            G/B     Am
 On Him whom knew no sin
.          F
 A holy surrender
.C/E          F                Am
 The sky went dark, the angels wept
.                   G
 The Father looked away
.C/E        F                   Am
 The final breath, He bowed His head
.                    G
 The Lamb of God was slain

[C]
.       C                 F
 By His wounds, I am set free
.       C/E               F
 By His blood I've been redeemed
.            Am      C/E         F
 The great divide He crossed for me
.               C/G    G     C
 Oh, praise the God of Calvary

.C                                G/B      Am
 On the hill of Calvary, into the Father's hands
.         F
 A holy surrender
.  C/E      F                Am
 A borrowed tomb, His mother wept
.                   G
 And there His body lay
.C/E                F
 But the stone was moved
.              Am                  G
 He conquered death and rose from the grave

[B]
.        G                  Am            F
 And if I never, never lose sight of this place
.       G                 Am               C
 I will never, never lose sight of Your grace
.             G                  Am G
 The cross is all, all I need to see
.F              C/G    G     C
 Oh, praise the God of Calvary
