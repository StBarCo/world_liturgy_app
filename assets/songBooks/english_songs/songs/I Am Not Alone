[1]
.C#m                A           F#m
 When I walk through deep waters 
.                            C#m   B   C#m
 I know that You will be with me
.                A            F#m
 When I'm standing in the fire
.                  C#m   B   F#m
 I will not be overcome ||
.                           C#m
 Through the valley of the shadow
.E           B
 I will not fear

[C]
.          E
 I am not alone
.          B 
 I am not alone
.             C#m
 You will go before me
.               A
 You will never leave me

[B]
.     A
 You amaze me
.
 Redeem me
.     B
 You call me as Your own

.C#m                A           F#m
 In the midst of deep sorrow
.                            C#m   B   C#m
 I see Your light is breaking through
.                A            F#m
 The dark of night will not overtake me
.                  C#m   B   F#m
 I am pressing into You ||

 Lord, You fight my every battle
.E           B
 And I will not fear

[3]
.C#m               
 You're my strength
.     A              F#m
 You're my defender
.                       C#m    B   
 You're my refuge in the storm ||
.C#m
 Through these trials
.       A
 You've always been faithful
.F#m                      B
 You bring healing to my soul</lyrics>
