  <title>More About Jesus</title>
  <lyrics>


[1]
More about Jesus would I know,
More of His grace to others show;
More of his saving fullness see,
More of His love who died for me.

[C]
Refrain:
  More, more about Jesus,
  More, more about Jesus;
  More of His saving fullness see,
  More of His love who died for me.


[2]
More about Jesus let me learn,
More of his holy will discern;
Spirit of God, my teacher be,
Showing the things of Christ to me. 
[B]  [Refrain]


[3]
More about Jesus in His Word,
Holding communion with my Lord;
Hearing his voice in ev'ry line,
Making each faithful saying mine. 
[B]  [Refrain]


[4]
More about Jesus on his throne,
Riches in glory all His own;
More if His kingdom's sure increase;
More of His coming, Prince of peace. 
[B]  [Refrain]
