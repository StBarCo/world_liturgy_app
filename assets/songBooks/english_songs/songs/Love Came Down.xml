  <lyrics>[1]
.      Dbmaj7
 If my heart is overwhelmed
.      Fm               Eb
 And I cannot hear Your voice
.       Dbmaj7                          Ab     Eb
 I'll hold on to what is true, though I cannot see  ||
.       Dbmaj7
 If the storms of life they come
.        Fm              Eb
 And the road ahead gets steep
.       Dbmaj7                       Ab     Eb
 I will lift these hands in faith, I will believe

[P]
.  Bbm7             Ab/F             Eb
 I remind myself of all that You've done
.        Bbm7         Ab/F           Db
 And the life I have because of Your Son

 When my heart is filled with hope

 And every promise comes my way
.       Dbmaj7                          Ab   Eb
 When I feel Your hands of grace rest upon me ||
.        Dbmaj7
 Staying desperate for You God
.        Fm              Eb
 Staying humbled at Your feet
.       Dbmaj7                      Ab       Eb/G
 I will lift these hands and praise I will believe
