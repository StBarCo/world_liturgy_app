 Crown Him with many crowns

 The Lamb upon His throne
.      F#m     E        B/D#   E
 Hark! How the heavenly anthem drowns
.    E     B       Esus
 All music but its own ||

 Awake, my soul and sing

 Of Him who died for me

 And hail Him as thy matchless King

 Through all eternity

.D2       A/C#
 Majesty, Lord of all

 Let every throne, before Him fall ||

 The King of Kings

 Our God who reigns forevermore

[2]
 Crown Him the Lord of life
 Who triumphed o'er the grave
 And rose victorious in the strife
 For those He came to save ||
 His glories now we sing
 Who died and rose on high
 Who died eternal life to bring
 And lives that death may die


[B]
.    D2      A/C#    Esus
 All hail, Redeemer, hail
.    A      A/C#     D2
 For He has died for me ||
.    D2         A     F#m       Esus
 His praise and glory shall not fail
.       D2   Esus A (F#m)
 Throughout eternity

 The King of Kings

 Our God who reigns forevermore ||
