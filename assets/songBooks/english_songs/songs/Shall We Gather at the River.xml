  <title>Shall We Gather at the River?</title>
  <lyrics>


[1]
Shall we gather at the river,
Where bright angel feet have trod;
With its crystal tide forever
Flowing by the throne of God?

[C]
Refrain:
  Yes, we'll gather at the river,
  The beautiful, the beautiful river;
  Gather with the saints at the river
  That flows by the throne of God.

[2]
On the margin of the river,
Washing up its silver spray,
We will walk and worship ever,
All the happy golden day. 
[B] [Refrain]

[3]
Ere we reach the shining river,
Lay we ev'ry burden down;
Grace our spirits will deliver,
And provide a robe and crown. 
[B] [Refrain]

[4]
Soon we'll reach the shining river,
Soon our pilgrimage will cease;
Soon our happy hearts will quiver
With the melody of peace. 
[B] [Refrain]
