  <lyrics>[1]
.C                          F
 You hold the reins on the sun and the moon
.      Am               F
 Like horses driven by kings
.     C                         F
 You cover the mountains, the valleys below
.          Am                     F
 With the breadth of your mighty wings


[P]
.     F                       C/E
 All treasures of wisdom and things to be known
.     Am     G           F
 Are hidden inside Your hand
.    F                 C/E
 And in this fortunate turn of events
.    Am        G        F         F
 You ask me to be Your friend
.    Am        G        F         F
 You ask me to be Your friend


[C]
.    C                                  G
 And You, You are my first, You are my last
.           Dm C   Am  G   F   -   C   
 You are my future and my past
.    C                                  G
 And You, You are my first, You are my last
.           Dm C   Am  G   F   -   C   
 You are my future and my past


[B]
.Dm           C/E               F
 You are the beginning and the end

.       C                F
 The constellations are swimming inside
.     Am              F
 The breadth of Your desire
.C                   F
 Where could I run, where could I hide
.Am                        F
 From Your hearts jealous fire</lyrics>
