  <title>Oh, How I Love Jesus</title>
  <lyrics>

[1]There is a name I love to hear, 
I love to sing its worth; 
it sounds like music in my ear, 
the sweetest name on earth.

[C]Refrain:
  O how I love Jesus, 
  O how I love Jesus, 
  O how I love Jesus, 
  because he first loved me!

[2]It tells me of a Savior's love, 
who died to set me free; 
it tells me of his precious blood, 
the sinner's perfect plea. 
[B] [Refrain]

[3]It tells of one whose loving heart 
can feel my deepest woe; 
who in each sorrow bears a part 
that none can bear below. 
[B] [Refrain]
