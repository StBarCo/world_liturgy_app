  <title>I Know Not Why God's Wondrous Grace</title>
  <lyrics>

[1]
I know not why God's wondrous grace
to me he has made known,
nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
redeemed me for his own.

[C]
Refrain:
  But "I know whom I have believed,
  and am persuaded that he is able
  to keep that which I've committed
  unto him against that day."

[2]
I know not how this saving faith
to me he did impart,
nor how believing in his Word
wrought peace within my heart. 

 [B] [Refrain]

[3]
I know not how the Spirit moves,
convincing men of sin,
revealing Jesus through the Word,
creating faith in him. 
 [B] [Refrain]

[4]
I know not what of good or ill
may be reserved for me,
of weary ways or golden days,
before his face I see. 
 [B] [Refrain]


[5]
I know not when my Lord may come,
at night or noonday fair,
nor if I'll walk the vale with him,
or meet him in the air. 
 [B] [Refrain]
