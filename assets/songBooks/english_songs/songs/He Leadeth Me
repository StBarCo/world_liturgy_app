 <lyrics>[V]
. D D/F# G D A
He leadeth me! O blessed thought! O words with heavenly comfort fraught!
. D D/F# G D Bm D A D
What e'er I do, where'er I be, Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.

Lord, I would clasp Thy hand in mine, Nor ever murmur nor repine,
Content, what ever lot I see, Since God through Jordan leadeth me.

E'en death's cold wave I will not flee, Since God through Jordan leadeth me.
And when my task on earth is done, When by Thy grace the victory's won,


[C]
. D A D G D Bm D A
 He leadeth me, He leadeth me; By His own hand He leadeth me:
. D A D G D Bm D A D
 His faithful follower I would be, For by His hand He leadeth me.</lyrics></song>
