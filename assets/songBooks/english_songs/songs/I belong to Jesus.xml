  <lyrics>

[1]
I belong to Jesus
'Twas a happy day
When His blood most precious
Washed my sins away
When His Holy Spirit
Changed my heart of stone
Set His mark upon me
Sealed me for His own

[2]
I belong to Jesus
So I'll try to spend
All my life in pleasing
My Almighty Friend
Since He is so Holy
I must watch and pray
That I may grow like Him
More and more each day'
  

[3]
I belong to Jesus
Therefore I can sing, 
For I'm safe and happy 
Underneath His wing  
But so many round me 
Are all dark and cold, 
I must try to bring them 
Into Jean's fold. 

[4]
I belong to Jesus  
Soon He will be here  
If I love and trust Him, 
What have I to fear ? 
Round about Him gathered 
Will remember me.
