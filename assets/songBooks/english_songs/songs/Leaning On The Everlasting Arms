[1]
.G                     C2                   G                          D
What a fellowship, what a joy divine!
Leaning on the everlasting arms;
.G                     C2                     G                  D       G
What a blessedness, what a peace is mine!
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

[C]
.G        C2       G                         D
Leaning, leaning, Safe and secure from all alarms;
.G        C2       G                  D       G
Leaning, leaning, Leaning on the everlasting arms.
[2]
O how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way,
Leaning on the everlasting arms;
O how bright the path grows from day to day,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
[3]
What have I do dread? What have I to fear?
Leaning on the everlasting arms;
I have blessed peace with my Lord so near,  
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
