  <title>There Shall Be Showers of Blessing</title>
  <lyrics>

[1] There shall be showers of blessing: 
This is the promise of love;
There shall be seasons refreshing, 
Sent from the Savior above. 

[C] Chorus:
   Showers of blessing,
   Showers of blessing we need:
   Mercy drops 'round us are falling, 
   But for the showers we plead. 

[2] There shall be showers of blessing-- 
Precious reviving again; 
Over the hills and the valleys, 
Sound of abundance of rain. 
[B] [Chorus] 

[3] There shall be showers of blessing: 
Send them upon us, O Lord;
Grant to us now a refreshing; 
Come and now honor Thy Word. 
[B] [Chorus] 

[4] There shall be showers of blessing: 
Oh, that today they might fall, 
Now as to God we're confessing, 
Now as on Jesus we call! 
[B] [Chorus]
