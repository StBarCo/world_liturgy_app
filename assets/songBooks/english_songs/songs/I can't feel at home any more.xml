  <title>I can't feel at home any more</title>
  <lyrics>

[1] 
This world is not my home, I'm just a passing through
My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue;
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door,
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.

[C]
Chorus:
  O Lord, you know I have no friend like you,
  If heaven's not my home, then Lord what will I do?
  The angels beckon me from heaven's open door,
  And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. 

[2]
They're all expecting me, and that's one thing I know,
My Savior pardoned me and now I onward go;
I know He'll take me thro' tho' I am weak and poor,
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. 
[B]  [Chorus]

[3]
I have a loving Savior up in glory-land,
I don't expect to stop until I with Him stand,
He's waiting now for me in heaven's open door,
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. 
[B]  [Chorus]

[4]
Just up in glory-land we'll live eternally,
The saints on every hand are shouting victory,
Their songs of sweetest praise drift back from heaven's shore,
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. 
[B]  [Chorus]
