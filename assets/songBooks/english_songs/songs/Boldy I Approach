  <title>Boldy I Approach</title>
  <lyrics>[1]
.Em        G              C
 By grace alone somehow I stand
.G           C             D
 Where even angels fear to tread ||
.Em      G            C
 Invited by redeeming love
.G          C             D
 Before the throne of God above ||
.G           C          D            Em
 He pulls me close with nail-scarred hands
.C        D            G
 Into His everlasting arms

[2]
.Em         G               C
 When condemnation grips my heart
.G         C            D
 And Satan tempts me to despair ||
.Em         G                   C
 I hear the voice that scatters fear
.G           C              D
 The Great I Am the Lord is here ||
.G             C       D          Em
 Oh praise the One who fights for me
.C              D           G
 And shields my soul eternally

[C]
.Em          C          D
 Boldly I approach Your throne
.Em                C       D
 Blameless now I'm running home ||
.G               C
 By Your blood I come
.D                Em
 Welcomed as Your own
.C                D     G
 Into the arms of majesty
---

[3]
.Em         G                C
 Behold the bright and risen Son
.G           C                   D
 More beauty than this world has known ||
.Em          G              C
 I'm face to face with Love Himself
.G           C                 D
 His perfect spotless righteousness ||
.G          C        D        Em
 A thousand years, a thousand tongues
.C         D                G
 Are not enough to sing His praise


[B]
.            C      G    D
 This is the art of celebration
.              C         G     D
 Knowing we're free from condemnation ||
.   G          C    D          Em
 Oh praise the One, praise the One
.    C              D      G
 Who made an end to all my sin</lyrics>
