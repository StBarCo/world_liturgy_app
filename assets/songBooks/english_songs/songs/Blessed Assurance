.           A      D          A     A/G#
 Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!

 O what a foretaste of glory divine!

 Heir of salvation, purchase of God,

 Born of his Spirit, washed in his blood.

[v2]
.            A     D           A     A/G#
 Perfect submission perfect delight
.            F#m  B                  E     E7
 visions of rapture now burst on my sight
.          A      D            A   A/G#  F#m  E
 angels descending bring from above
.           D    E             A
 echoes of mercy, whispers of love


[v3]

 Perfect submission all is at rest
.         F#m  B             E     E7
 I in my savior am happy and blessed
.               A    D         A   A/G#  F#m  E
 Watching and waiting looking above
.                 D      E                 A
 Filled with his goodness and lost in his love</lyrics>
