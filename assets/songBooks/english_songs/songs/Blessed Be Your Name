  <lyrics>[1]
.G       D                    
 Blessed be Your name
.       Em           C
 In the land that is plentiful
.           G          D
 Where Your streams of abundance flow
.C
 Blessed be Your name ||
.G           D
 And blessed be Your name
.         Em           C
 When I'm found in the desert place ||
.         G                D
 Though I walk through the wilderness
.C
 Blessed be Your name

[p]
.G              D
 Every blessing You pour out I'll
.             C
 Turn back to praise  ||
.G                     D              Em
 And when the darkness closes in, Lord
.             C
 Still I will say


[C]
.               G           D
 Blessed be the name of the Lord
.                Em    C
 Blessed be Your name ||
.               G           D
 Blessed be the name of the Lord
.                Em  D    C
 Blessed be Your glorious name

[2]
.G       D
 Blessed be Your name
.         Em            C
 When the sun's shining down on me ||
.         G              D
 When the world's all as it should be
.C
 Blessed be Your name ||
.G           D
 And blessed be Your name
.       Em               C
 On the road marked with suffering  ||
.               G           D
 Though there's pain in the offering
.C
 Blessed be Your name


[B]
.    G              D
 You give and take away
.    Em             C
 You give and take away ||
.   G                    D
 My heart will choose to say
.      Em               C
 Lord, blessed be Your name</lyrics>
