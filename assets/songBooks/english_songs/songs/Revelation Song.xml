  <lyrics>[Intro]
.D  Am  C  G    


[1]
.D             Am
  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
.C             G
  Holy Holy is He ||
.D                Am
  Sing a new song to Him who sits on
.C                 G
  Heaven's mercy seat
                         

[C]
.D
  Holy  Holy  Holy
.Am
  Is the Lord God Almighty
.C                         G
  Who was and is and is to come ||
.D
  With all creation I sing
.Am
  Praise to the King of Kings
.C
  You are my everything
.G                    
  And I will adore You

[2]
.D                   Am
  Clothed in rainbows of living color
.C                             G
  Flashes of lightning rolls of thunder ||
.D                               Am
  Blessing and honor strength and glory and power be
.C                    G
  To You the only wise King


[3]
.D                 Am
  Filled with wonder awestruck wonder
.C                       G
  At the mention of your name ||
.D
  Jesus your name is power
.Am                      
  Breath and living water
.C                    G
  Such a marvelous mystery</lyrics>
