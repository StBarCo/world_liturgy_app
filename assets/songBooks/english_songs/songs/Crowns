  <lyrics>[1]
.G                 C   G  
 There is a hill I cherish
.Em                    D    
 Where stood a precious tree
.Em               C  G  
 The emblem of salvation
.Em          D    G 
 The gift of Calvary


[C]
.                    C    
 My wealth is in the cross
.        G              D   
 There's nothing more I want
.     Em               C   
 Than just to know His love
.   G               D     
 My heart is set on Christ
.           Em                C   
 And I will count all else as loss
.    G              D     
 The greatest of my crowns
.     Em            C  
 Mean nothing to me now
.      G               D   
 For I counted up the cost
.                            C    
 And all my wealth is in the cross

.G                  C   G 
 How is it I should profit
.Em                D  
 While He is crucified
.Em                  C G  
 Yet as His life was taken
.C        D       G   
 So I was granted mine


[3]
.G                   C   G 
 I will not boast in riches
.Em                D    
 I have no pride in gold
.Em                  C G  
 But I will boast in Jesus
.C          D     G   
 And in Nis Name alone


[4]
.G                   C  G 
 And when I stand in glory
.Em                  D    
 My crowns before the Lord
.Em                C  G   
 Let this be my confession
.C            D      G    
 My wealth is in the cross
