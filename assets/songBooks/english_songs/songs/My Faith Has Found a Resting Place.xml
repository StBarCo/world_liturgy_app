  <title>My Faith Has Found a Resting Place</title>
  <lyrics>


[1]
My faith has found a resting place,
from guilt my soul is freed;
I trust the ever-living One,
his wounds for me shall plead.

[C]
Refrain:
  I need no other argument,
  I need no other plea,
  it is enough that Jesus died,
  and that he died for me.

[2]
Enough for me that Jesus saves,
this ends my fear and doubt;
a sinful soul, I come to him,
he’ll never cast me out. [Refrain]

[3]
My heart is leaning on the Word,
the written Word of God,
salvation by my Savior’s name,
salvation thro' his blood. [Refrain]

[4]
My great Physician heals the sick,
the lost he came to save;
for me his precious blood he shed,
for me his life he gave. [Refrain]
