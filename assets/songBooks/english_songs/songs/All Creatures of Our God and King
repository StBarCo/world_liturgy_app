  <lyrics>
[1]
 All creatures of our God and King, 
lift up your voice and with us sing 
alleluia, alleluia! 
Thou burning sun with golden beam, 
thou silver moon with softer gleam, 
[B]
O praise him, O praise him, 
alleluia, alleluia, alleluia! 


[2]
Thou rushing wind that art so strong, 
ye clouds that sail in heav'n along, 
O praise him, alleluia! 
Thou rising morn, in praise rejoice, 
ye lights of evening, find a voice, 
[B]
O praise him, O praise him, 
alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!


[3]
Thou flowing water, pure and clear, 
make music for thy Lord to hear, 
alleluia, alleluia!
Thou fire so masterful and bright, 
that givest man both warmth and light, 
[B]
O praise him, O praise him, 
alleluia, alleluia, alleluia! 


[4]
And all ye men of tender heart,
forgiving others, take your part, 
O sing ye, alleluia! 
Ye who long pain and sorrow bear,
praise God and on him cast your care,
[B]
O praise him, O praise him, 
alleluia, alleluia, alleluia! 


[5]
Let all things their Creator bless,
and worship him in humbleness,
O praise him, alleluia!
Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son,
and praise the Spirit, three in one, 
[B]
O praise him, O praise him, 
alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
