  <title>Onward, Christian Soldiers</title>
  <lyrics>

[1]
Onward, Christian soldiers, 
marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
going on before!
Christ, the royal Master,
leads against the foe;
Forward into battle,
see his banner go!

[C]
Refrain:
  Onward, Christian soldiers,
  marching as to war,
  With the cross of Jesus
  going on before!


[2]
At the sign of triumph
Satan's host doth flee;
On, then, Christian soldiers,
on to victory!
Hell's foundations quiver
at the shout of praise;
Brothers, lift your voices,
loud your anthems raise! 
[B]  [Refrain]

[3]
Like a mighty army
moves the church of God;
Brothers, we are treading
where the saints have trod;
We are not divided;
all one body we,
One in hope and doctrine,
one in charity. 
[B]  [Refrain]

[4]
Onward, then, ye people,
join our happy throng,
Blend with ours your voices
in the triumph song;
Glory, laud, and honor,
unto Christ the King;
This thro' countless ages
men and angels sing. 
[B]  [Refrain]
