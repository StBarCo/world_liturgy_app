  <title>Pass Me Not</title>
  <lyrics>


[1]
Pass me not, O gentle Savior;
hear my humble cry;
while on others thou art calling,
do not pass me by.

[C]
Refrain:
  Savior, Savior,
  hear my humble cry;
  while on others thou art calling,
  do not pass me by.

[2]
Let me at thy throne of mercy
find a sweet relief;
kneeling there in deep contrition,
help my unbelief. 
[B]  [Refrain]

[3]
Trusting only in thy merit,
would I seek thy face;
heal my wounded, broken spirit,
save me by thy grace. 
[B]  [Refrain]

[4]
Thou the spring of all my comfort,
more than life to me,
whom have I on earth beside thee?
Whom in heaven but thee? 
[B]  [Refrain]
