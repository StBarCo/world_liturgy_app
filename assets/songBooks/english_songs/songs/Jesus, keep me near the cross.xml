  <title>Jesus, keep me near the cross</title>
  <lyrics>

[1]
Jesus, keep me near the cross,
There a precious fountain;
Free to all, a healing stream,
Flows from Calv'ry's mountain. 

[C]
Refrain:
 In the cross, in the cross
 Be my glory ever,
 Till my ransomed soul shall find
 Rest beyond the river.

[2]
Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the Bright and Morning Star
Shed His beams around me. 
[B]  [Refrain]

[3]
Near the cross! O lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day
With its shadow o'er me. 
[B]  [Refrain]

[4]
Near the cross! I'll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever;
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river. 
[B]  [Refrain]
