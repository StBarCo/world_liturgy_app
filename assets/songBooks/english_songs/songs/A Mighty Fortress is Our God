[1]
A mighty fortress is our God,
a Bulwark never fa_i_ling;
Our Helper He amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing;
For still our ancient Foe
doth seek to work us woe;
His craft and pow'r are great,
and armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.

[2]
Did we in our own strength confide,
our striving would be losing;
Were not the right Man on our side,
the Man of God's own choosing;
Dost ask who that may be:
Christ Jesus it is He;
Lord Sabbaoth His name,
from age to age the same,
And He must win the battle.
[3]
And though this world with devils filled
should threaten  to undo   us;
We will not fear for God hath willed
His truth to triumph through us:
The prince of darkness grim,
we tremble not for him;
Hisrage we can endure
for lo, his doom is sure,
One little word shall fell him.

[4]
That Word above all earthly pow'r,
no thanks to them abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
through Him who with us sideth;
Let goods and kindred go,
this mortal  life al_so;
The body they may kill;
God's truth abideth  still,
His kingdom is forever!
