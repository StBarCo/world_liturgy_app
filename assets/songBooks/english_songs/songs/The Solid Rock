 <lyrics>[1]
. E   B   A  B E
My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
. E   B   A  B E
I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name.
[C]
. E   A
On Christ, the solid rock I stand;
. E   B
All other ground is sinking sand,
. A  B E
All other ground is sinking sand.
[2]When darkness veils His lovely face, I rest on His unchanging grace.
In every high and stormy gale, my anchor holds within the veil.
[3]His oath, His covenant, His blood|support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way, He then is all my hope and stay.
[4]When He shall come with trumpet sound, O may I then in Him be found;
Dressed in His righteousness alone, faultless to stand before the throne.
