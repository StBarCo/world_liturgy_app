  <title>Fire Fall Down</title>
  <lyrics>[1]
.E
 You bought my life with the
.                              A
 Blood that You shed on the cross
.
 When You died for the sins of men
.         B
 And you let out a cry
.                       E
 Crucified now alive in me

[2]
.E
 These hands are Yours
.                             A
 Teach them to serve as You please
.
 And I'll reach out desperate to see
.        B
 All the greatness of God
.                           E
 May my soul rest assured in You

[P]
.A                 B
 I'll never be the same
.A                 B
 No I'll never be the same

[C]
.        E                  A
 Cause I know that You're alive
.        E                  A
 You came to fix my broken life
.         E            A
 And I'll sing to glorify
.        C#m           A
 Your Holy Name, Jesus Christ

[3]
.E
 You changed it all
.
 You broke down the wall
.       A
 When I spoke and confessed
.
 In You I am blessed
.      B
 Now I walk in the light
.                       E
 In victorious sight of You


[T]
.E               
 Your fire fall down
.A
 Your fire fall down
.C#m       A
 On us we pray
.
 As we seek


[B]
.E             A
 Show me your heart
.             C#m
 Show me your way
.              A
 Show me your glory</lyrics>
