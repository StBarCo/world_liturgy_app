No turning back, no turning back.

The world be___hind me,    the cross be_fore me,
The world be___hind me,    the cross be_fore me,
The world be___hind me,    the cross be_fore me,
No turning back, no turning back.

Though none go with me,    still I will follow,

Though none go with me,    still I will follow,

Though none go with me,    still I will follow,

No turning back, no turning back.</lyrics></song>
