.          C   G
 Let it be Jesus
.     Em               D
 The first name that I call
.          C   G
 Let it be Jesus         
.    Em              D
 My song inside the storm
.     Am                  C
 I'll never need another


[C]
.    G       D      C
 For me, to live is Christ
.    G       D      C
 For me, to live is Christ
.       G            D          C
 God I breathe Your name above everything
.       G          D   C
 Let it be, Let it be Jesus

[2]
.          C   G
 Let it be Jesus
.         Em            D
 From the rising of the sun
.          C   G
 Let it be Jesus
.     Em              D
 When all is said and done
.     Am                  
 I'll never need another
.C
 Jesus there's no other


[B]
.         D
 Should I ever be abandoned
.         Em
 Should I ever be acclaimed
.         D                         
 Should I ever be surrounded
.       Em
 By the fire and the flame ||
.          D
 There's a name I will remember
.          Em
 There's a name I will proclaim
.       G          D  C
 Let it be, let it be Jesus</lyrics>
