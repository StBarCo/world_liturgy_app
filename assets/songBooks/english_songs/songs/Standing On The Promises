[V]
.G
Standing on the promises of Christ, my King!
.C                                    G
Through eternal ages let His praises ring;
.G
"Glory in the highest!" I will shout and sing,
.                Am   D      G
Standing on the promises of God.
[C]
.G         C   Em
Standing, standing,
.D                           G         C  G
Standing on the promises of Christ my Saviour;
.          C
Standing, standing
.    G               Dsus D      G
I'm standing on the promises of God.
[2]
Standing on the promises that cannot fail,
2When the howling storms of doubt and fears assail,
By the living Word of God I shall prevail,
Standing on the promises of God.
[3]
Standing on the promises, I now can see
Perfect, present cleansing in the blood for me;
Standing in the liberty where Christ makes free,
Standing on the promises of God.
[4]
Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord,
Bound to Him eternally by love's strong cord,
Overcoming daily with the Spirit's sword,
Standing on the promises of God.
[5]
Standing on the promises, I cannot fall,
List'ning every moment to the Spirit's call,
Resting in my Saviour as my All-in-All,
Standing on the promises of God.
