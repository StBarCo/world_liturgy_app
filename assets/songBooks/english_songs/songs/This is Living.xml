 This freedom's untainted with You

 No moment is wasted


[P]
.G               A
 See the sun now bursting through the clouds

 Black and white turns to colour all around

 All is new, in the Saviour I am found

 You lead the way, God You're right beside me

 In Your love, I'm complete

 You take me higher than I've been before

 It's Your perfect love that sees me soar

 Now Your freedom is an open door
.         Bm                   Em
 You are everything I want and more
