.            G
 All who are thirsty
.            Bm 
 All who are weak
.            C2
 Come to the fountain 
.                      Am     G/B C2
 Dip your heart in the stream of life ||
.        Dsus         G
 Let the pain and the sorrow
.          Bm 
 Be washed away
.                   C2
 In the wave of his mercy
.              Am  G/B C    Dsus 
 As deep cries out to deep, we sing

[C]
.G                C2
 Come Lord Jesus, come

[B]
.  G               Bm
 Nothing but your will for me
. Am               G/B
 I am only free in Him
