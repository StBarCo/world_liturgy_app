  <title>I Need Thee Every Hour</title>
  <lyrics>

[1]
I need thee every hour,
most gracious Lord;
no tender voice like thine
can peace afford.

[C]
Refrain:
  I need thee, O I need thee;
  every hour I need thee!
  O bless me now, my Savior,
  I come to thee.

[2]
I need thee every hour,
stay thou near by;
temptations lose their power
when thou art nigh. 
[B]  [Refrain]

[3]
I need thee every hour, 
in joy or pain;
come quickly, and abide,
or life is vain. 
[B]  [Refrain]

[4]
I need thee every hour;
teach me thy will,
and thy rich promises
in me fulfill. 
[B]  [Refrain]
