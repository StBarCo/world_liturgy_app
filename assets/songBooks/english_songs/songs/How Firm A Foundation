[1]
. G C G G D
How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
. G C G Em G/D D7 G
Is laid for your faith in His excellent word!
. G Em G D
What more can He say than to you He hath said,
. G C G Em G/D D7 G
To you who for refuge to Jesus hath fled.

[2]
"Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed,
For I am your God, and will still give thee aid;
I'll strengthen thee, help thee and cause thee to stand,
Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand."
[3]
"When through the deep waters I call thee to go,
The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow;
For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress."
[4]
"When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
My grace, all sufficient shall be thy supply;
The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine."

[5]
"The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose,
I will not, I will not desert to his foes;
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,
I'll never, no never, no never forsake!"
