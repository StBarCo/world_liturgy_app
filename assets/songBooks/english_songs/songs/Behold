.G
 Behold the Father's heart
.     C
 The mystery He lavishes on us
.   Em                G
 As deep cries out to deep
.                     C
 Oh how desperately He wants us ||
.    Em                        G
 The things of earth stand next to Him
.                       C
 Like a candle to the sun ||
.         Em
 Unfailing Father
.       D                  C
 What compares to His great love

[C]
.             G(Em)
 Then sings my soul
.             Em(G)
 Then sings my soul
.              D
 How great Your love is
.              C
 How great Your love is

.G
 Behold His holy Son
.   C
 The Lion and the Lamb given to us
.   Em               G
 The Word became a man
.                               C
 That my soul should know its Saviour ||
.   Em                          G
 Forsaken for the sake of all mankind
.                   C
 Salvation is in His blood ||
.          Em
 Jesus Messiah
.      D               C
 The righteous died for love
.          Em
 It wasn't over
.      D            C
 For He is the risen One

[3]
. G
 Behold I have a friend
.    C
 The Spirit breathing holy fire within
.   Em           G
 My ever present help
.                            C
 Speaking truth when I can't find it ||
.      Em                                G
 Light up this broken heart and light my way
.                          C
 Until my time on earth is done
.          Em
 Oh Holy Spirit
.          D               C
 Breathe in me like kingdom come ||
.          Em
 Oh Holy Spirit
.        D             C
 Let Your Work in me be done</lyrics>
