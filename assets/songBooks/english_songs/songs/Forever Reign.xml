  <lyrics>[1]
.        A
 You are good, You are good
.
 When there's nothing good in me
.        E/G#
 You are love, You are love
.
 On display for all to see ||
.        A
 You are light, You are light
.
 When the darkness closes in
.        E/G#
 You are hope, You are hope
.                          A
 You have covered all my sin


[C]
.A                       E/A
 Oh, I’m running to Your arms
.                    F#m
 I’m running to Your arms
.                   E/F#
 The riches of Your love
.     E          D
 Will always be enough ||
.           F#m7     E        D
 Nothing compares to Your embrace
.             F#m        E    D (C)
 Light of the world, forever reign

[2]
 You are peace, You are peace
 When my fear is crippling
 You are true, You are true
 Even in my wandering ||
 You are joy, You are joy
 You're the reason that I sing
 You are life, You are life,
 In You death has lost it's sting


[3]
 You are more, You are more
 Than my words will ever say
 You are Lord, You are Lord
 All creation will proclaim ||
 You are here, You are here
 In Your presence I'm made whole
 You are God, You are God
 Of all else I'm letting go


[b]
.F#m
  My heart will sing,
.D
  No other name
.A      E   
 Jesus, Jesus
