.G       C                      G
 Are you hurting and broken within

 Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin
.         C
 Jesus is calling ||
.G       C                     G
 Have you come to the end of yourself
.       C                           Em
 Do you thirst for a drink from the well
.         C
 Jesus is calling

 O come to the altar
.             C
 The Father's arms are open wide ||
.G          Am7             Em
 Forgiveness was bought with
.             C              G
 The precious blood of Jesus Christ
