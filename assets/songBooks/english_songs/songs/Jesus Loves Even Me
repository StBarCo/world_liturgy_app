.G
I am so glad that our Father in heaven
.D7                        C       D7    G
Tells of His love in the  Book He has   given.
.G
Wonderful things in my Bible I see-
.D7                        C     D7    G
This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.
[C]
.G                 C
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
.D7              G
Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me.
.G                 C
I am so glad that Jesus loves me;
.D7          C D   G
Jesus loves e_ven me.
[2]
Tho' I forget Him and wander away,
Still He doth love me wherever    I     stray.
Back to His dear, loving arms would I flee
When I remember that      Jesus loves me.
[3]
O if there's only one song I can sing
When in His beauty I      see the great King,
This shall my song in eternity be:
"O what a wonder, that    Jesus loves me!"
