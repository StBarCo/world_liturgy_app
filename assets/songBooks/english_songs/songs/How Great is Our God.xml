  <lyrics>[1]
.    G
 The splendor of the King
.Em7
 clothed in majesty
.                   C2
 Let all the earth rejoice
.
 All the earth rejoice ||
.   G
 He wraps Himself in light
.    Em7
 And darkness tries to hide
.                     C2
 And trembles at his voice
.
 Trembles at his voice


[C]
.    G                 D/F#
 How great is our God, sing with me
.    Em7               D/F#
 How great is our God, all will see
.    C          D            C  G
 How great, how great is our God

.G
 Age to age He stands
.    Em
 And time is in His hands
.                  C
 Beginning and the end

 Beginning and the end ||
.    G
 The Godhead, three in one
.Em
 Father, Spirit, Son
.                 C
 The Lion and the Lamb
.
 The Lion and the Lamb

.G              D/F#

 Worthy of all praise
