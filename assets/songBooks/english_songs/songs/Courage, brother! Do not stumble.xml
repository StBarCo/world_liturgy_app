  <title>Courage, brother! Do not stumble</title>
  <lyrics>

[1]
Courage, brother! do not stumble,
though your path be dark as night;
there's a star to guide the humble:
trust in God, and do the right.
Let the road be rough and dreary,
and its end far out of sight;
foot it bravely; strong or weary,
Trust in God and do the right.
Trust in God and do the right.

[2]
Perish policy and cunning,
perish all that fears the light!
Whether losing, whether winning,
trust in God, and do the right.
Some will hate you, some will love you,
some will flatter, some will slight;
heed them not, and look above you:
Trust in God and do the right.
Trust in God and do the right.

[3]
Simple rule and safest guiding,
inward peace, and inward might,
star upon our path abiding,
trust in God, and do the right.
Courage, sister! do not stumble,
though your path be dark as night;
there's a star to guide the humble:
Trust in God and do the right.
Trust in God and do the right.
