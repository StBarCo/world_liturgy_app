  <lyrics>[1]
.G         D             G 
 Brothers, let us come together
.D              Em                  G
 Walking in the Spirit, there's much to be done!
.   Em                       D        C  G 
 We will come reaching, out from our comforts
.Am                           D
 And they will know us by our love.

.         D       C
 The time is now
.               G
 Come Church a-rise
.          D          C
 Love with His hands
.          G
 See with His eyes...
.     D     Em
 Bind it a-round you,
.Em     D     C     G
 Let it never leave you,
.Am             D               G             
 And they will know us by our love

.G        D       Am       G  
 Sisters, we were made for kindness
.D                 Em             Am      G 
 We can pierce the darkness as He shines through us.
.  Em                          D       C   G 
 We will come reaching, with a song of healing
.Am             D              G
 And they will know us by our love!

.G          D                 G    
 Children, You are hope for justice,
.D                  Em                  D      C G
 Stand firm in the Truth now, set your hearts a-bove
.D            Em             D      C     G
 You will be reaching, long after we're gone,
.Am             D                 G
 And they will know you by your love!
