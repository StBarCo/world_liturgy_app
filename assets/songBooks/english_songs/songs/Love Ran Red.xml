  <title>Love Ran Red</title>
  <lyrics>[1]
.          Em     
 There’s a place,
.      D/F#  G        G/B     C
 Where mercy reigns and never dies
.          Em      
 There’s a place
.      D/F#      G      G/B            C
 Where streams of grace flows deep and wide


[P]
.        D              C 
 All the love I’ve ever found
.             D                  C  
 Comes like a flood comes flowing down


[C]
.       C   
 At the cross at the cross
.     G
 I surrender my life
.       D                 Am
 I’m in awe of You I’m in awe of You ||
.           C                   G
 Where your love ran red and my sins washed white
.      D                Am
 I owe all to you I owe all to you
.   C       
 Jesus

.           Em   
 There’s a place
.      D/F#    G     G/B      C
 Where sin and shame are powerless
.         Em  
 Where my heart
.    D/F#       G       G/B   C  
 Has peace with God and forgiveness


[B]
.C                     Em
 Here my hope is found here on holy ground
.G               D
 Here I bow down here I bow down ||
.C                   Em
 Here arms open wide here You saved my life
.G               D
 Here I bow down here I bow</lyrics>
