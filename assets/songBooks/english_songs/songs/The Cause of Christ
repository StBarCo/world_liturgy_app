  <lyrics>[1]
.    A                    E 
 The only thing I want in life
.   Bm7                    F#m7
 Is to be known for loving Christ
.   A                             E  
 To build His church, to love His bride
.    Bm7                 A/C#    D
 And make His name known far and wide


[C]
.         Dadd9   A             F#m7      E
 For this cause I live for this cause I’d die
.A/C#  Dadd9  A           F#m7     E
  I surrender all for the cause of Christ
.A/C#  Dadd9     A           F#m7    E 
 All I once held dear I will leave behind
.A/C#   Dadd9   A            F#m7  E  A 
 For my joy is  this oh, the cause of Christ

.A                      E 
 He is all my soul will prize
.  Bm7                F#m7
 Regardless of joy or trial
.     A                   E 
 When agonizing questions rise
.   Bm7          A/C#  D
 In Jesus all my hope abides.


[B]
.Bm7       F#m7           A               E
 Jesus, my Jesus for Your glory, for Your name
.Bm7       F#m7         A              E
 Jesus, my Jesus I will only sing Your praise


[3]
.   A                    E 
 It is not fame that I desire
.    Bm7                     F#m7
 Nor stature in my brother’s eye
.  A                       E 
 I pray it’s said about my life
.             Bm7                A/C#      D
 That I lived more to build Your name than mine
