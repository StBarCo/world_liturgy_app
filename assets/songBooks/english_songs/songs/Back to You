  <title>Back to You</title>
  <lyrics>
    [1]
 I'm sorry, Lord, for the heir I've become
 I never thought that I would be this far from home
 All the love you gave never lied in waste
 It keeps me hanging on
 When I look around and there's nowhere else to run

[p]
 These filthy hands I lift in faith
 Longing for redeeming grace
 To cleanse my heart and bring me back to You

[c]
 Bring me back to You
 I'm so undeserving of the love
 You so freely offer us
 I will place my trust in You and never look back
 Because of who You are, because of what You've done

[2]
 Forgive me, Lord, for my ungrateful heart
 When I thought that I would be better off alone
 When deception came, thought I had the strength to fight foolishness away
 I forgot where all my strength comes from
---

[t]
 When I see Your open arms of love
 Welcoming Your prodigal home
 There's nothing that can hold me back from You
[t]
 So I will run
 Yes I will run
 God I will run
 Yes I will run
 To you
 God we will run to you
 Ohhh</lyrics>
