.        C             G
 Should nothing of our efforts stand
.    Am       F
 No legacy survive
.  C                  G
 Unless the Lord does raise the house
.   Am     F           C
 In vain its builders strive
.   C                 G
 To you who boast tomorrow's gain
.    Am                F
 Tell me what is your life
.   C              G
 A mist that vanishes at dawn
.     Am    F       C
 All glory be to Christ!


[C]
.    C(D)         G(A)
 All glory be to Christ our King!
.    C(D)         F(G)
 All glory be to Christ!
.    C(D)                  G(A)
 His rule and reign we'll ever sing,
.   Am(Bm) F(G)   C(D)
 All glory be to Christ!

.    C
 His will be done
.    G
 His kingdom come
.    Am            F
 On earth as is above
.    C              G
 Who is Himself our daily bread
.       Am      F      C
 Praise Him the Lord of love
.    C            G
 Let living water satisfy
.    Am              F
 The thirsty without price
.      C              G
 We'll take a cup of kindness yet
.     Am   F    C
 All glory be to Christ!

[3]
.     D              A
 When on the day the great I am
.    Bm              G
 The faithful and the true
.    D                 A
 The Lamb who was for sinners slain
.   Bm     G          D
 Is making all things new
.  D                  A
 Behold our God shall live with us
.    Bm                G
 And be our steadfast light
.    D                A
 And we shall ere his people be
.    Bm    G      D
 All glory be to Christ!
