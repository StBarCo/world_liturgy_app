  <lyrics>[Intro]
.B C#m  E

[1]
.      B
 He's coming on the clouds
.                   C#m       E
 Kings and kingdoms will bow down
       G#m
 Every chain will break
    F#                         E
 As broken hearts declare His praise
                           F#
 For who can stop the Lord almighty?


[Chorus]
 B                           F#      G#m7
  Our God is the Lion, the Lion of Judah
                             F#           E
 He's roaring with power and fighting our battles
                F#
 Every knee will bow before Him
 B                          F#            G#m7
  Our God is the Lamb, the Lamb that was slain
                                F#               E       
 For the sins of the world, His blood breaks the chains
                F#                           E
 Every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb
                F#
 Every knee will bow before Him


[Verse 2]
   B
 So open up the gates
                    C#m      E
 Make way before the King of Kings
    G#m
 The God who comes to save
    F#                       E
 Is here to set the captives free 
                     F#
 For who can stop the Lord almighty?


[Bridge]
 C#m                  B/D#
   Who can stop the Lord almighty?
 E                    F#
   Who can stop the Lord almighty?</lyrics>
