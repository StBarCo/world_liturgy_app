  <title>A Shelter in the Time of Storm</title>
  <lyrics>

[1] The Lord's our Rock, in Him we hide 
A shelter in the time of storm;
Secure whatever ill betide 
A shelter in the time of storm.

[C]Refrain:
  O Jesus is a Rock in a weary land,
  A weary land, a weary land;
  O Jesus is a Rock in a weary land 
  A shelter in the time of storm.

[2] A shade by day, defense by night 
A shelter in the time of storm;
No fears alarm, no foes affright 
A shelter in the time of storm. 
[B] [Refrain]

[3] The raging storms may round us beat 
A shelter in the time of storm;
We'll never leave our safe retreat 
A shelter in the time of storm. 
[B] [Refrain]

[4] O Rock divine, O Refuge dear 
A shelter in the time of storm;
Be Thou our helper ever near 
A shelter in the time of storm. 
[B] [Refrain]
