  <title>Did You Feel the Mountains Tremble</title>
  <lyrics>[1]
.C
 Did you feel the mountains tremble
.F/A
 Did you hear the oceans roar
.Dm7
 When the people rose to sing of
.F                Gsus4    C
 Jesus Christ the risen One


[P1]
.           F/A                 C
 And we can see that God You're moving
.         F/A                C
 A mighty river through the nations
.              F/A               C
 And young and old will turn to Jesus ||
.Dm7
 Fling wide you heavenly gates,
.F/A                    Gsus  C   
 prepare the way of the risen Lord


[C]
.C                     F/A
 Open up the doors and let the music play
.Dm7                          C      Gsus
 let the streets resound with singing ||
.C                           
 Songs that bring Your hope 
.F/A
 Songs that bring Your joy
.Dm7                       C      Gsus4
 dancers who dance upon injustice

[2]
 Did you feel the people tremble
 Did you hear the singers roar
 When the lost began to sing of
 Jesus Christ the saving One

[3]
 Do you feel the darkness tremble
 when all the saints join in one song
 And all the streams flow as one river
 to wash away our brokenness


[p2]
.            F/A                  C
 And here we see that God You're moving
.          F/A          C
 A time of jubilee is coming
.               F/A            C
 When young and old return to Jesus ||
.F/D
 Fling wide you heavenly gates
.F/A                    Gsus   C  
 Prepare the way of the risen Lord
