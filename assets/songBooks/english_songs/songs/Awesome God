  <title>Awesome God</title>
  <lyrics>
    [1]
    When He rolls up His sleeves
    He ain't just puttin' on the Ritz
    (our God is an Awesome God)
    There is thunder in His footsteps
    And lightning in His fists
    (our God is an Awesome God)
    Well the Lord He wasn't jokin'
    When He kicked 'em out of Eden
    It wasn't for no reason that He shed His blood
    His return is very close and so you better be believin'
    That our God is an Awesome God

    [c]
.    D         A
 Our God is an awesome God
.   E           F#m
 He reigns from heaven above ||
.     D       A
 With wisdom, power and love
.    E                 F#m
 Our God is an awesome God

[2]

When the sky was starless in the void of the night
(our God is an awesome God)
He spoke into the darkness and created the light
(our God is an awesome God)
Judgement and wrath He poured out the Sodom
Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross
I hope that we have not too quickly forgotten that
Our God is an Awesome God
