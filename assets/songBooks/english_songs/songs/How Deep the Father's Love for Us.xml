  <title>How Deep the Father's Love for Us</title>
  <lyrics>[1]
.    D                 Em   D   G       D               Asus   A
 How deep the Father's love for us, how vast beyond all measure 
.     D                  Em  D  G     D             A    D
 That He should give His only Son, to make a wretch His treasure ||
.                      Em   D     G      D                 Bm    A
 How great the pain of searing loss, the Father turned His Face away 
.    D                   Em  D  G          D            A   D
 As wounds which mar the Chosen One, bring many sons to glory ||

.  D             Em  D  G        D            Asus    A
 Behold the man upon a cross, my sin upon His shoulders
.  D                Em  D  G          D             A    D
 Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice call out among the scoffers || 
.                   Em   D   G       D           Bm    A
 It was my sin that held Him there until it was accomplished
.    D                 Em     D  G       D               A   D
 His dying breath has brought me life; I know that it is finished||


[3]
.  D                 Em D  G      D                Asus    A
 I will not boast in anything, no gifts, no power, no wisdom
.    D               Em  D  G          D            A     D
 But I will boast in Jesus Christ; His death and resurrection  ||
.                       Em  D  G      D              Bm A
 Why should I gain from His reward? I cannot give an answer 
.    D                Em  D  G          D                   A   D
 But this I know with all my heart; His wounds have paid my ransom ||</lyrics>
