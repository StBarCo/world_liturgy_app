.G Em C D


[1]
.G
 My hope is built on nothing less
.C9                    D
 Than Jesus' blood and righteousness ||
.Em                   
 I dare not trust the sweetest frame
.C9         D           G
 But wholly trust is Jesus' name


[C]
.       C9    Em    D
 Christ alone, Cornerstone
.G/B       C9            Em       D
 Weak made strong in the Savior's love ||
.G           C9
 Through the storm
.Em    D
 He is Lord
.        G
 Lord of all


[T]
.      Em
 He is Lord
.        C   D
 Lord of all
---
[2]
.G
 When darkness seems to hide His face
.C9                       D
 I rest on His unchanging grace ||
.Em                
 In every high and stormy gale
.C9              D        Em
 My anchor holds within the veil
.C9              D        G
 My anchor holds within the veil


[3]
.G
 His oath, His covenant, His blood,
.C                 D
 Support me in the whelming flood;
.Em
 When all around my soul gives way,
.C          D               G
 He then is all my hope and stay
.C          D               G
 He then is all my hope and stay


[4]
.G
 When He shall come with trumpet sound
.C9               D
 Oh may I then in Him be found ||
.Em                      
 Dressed in His righteousness alone
.C9         D            G
 Faultless, stand before the throne
