  <lyrics>[1]
.G                       D
 The moon and stars they wept
.                    Em
 The morning sun was dead
.                   C
 The Savior of the world was fallen ||
.G               D
 His body on the cross
.                        Em
 His blood poured out for us
.                      C
 The weight of every curse upon Him

[p]
.G                    D
 The ground began to shake
.                     Em
 The stone was rolled away
.                       C
 His perfect love could not be overcome ||
.G                         D
 Now death where is your sting?
.                Em
 Our resurrected King
.                    C
 Has rendered you defeated
---
[C]
.G            D
 Forever He is glorified
.Em            C
 Forever He is lifted high
.G             D
 Forever He is risen
.      Em           C
 He is alive, He is alive


[2]
.G                   D
 One final breath He gave
.                 Em
 As heaven looked away
.                   C
 The Son of God was laid in darkness ||
.G               D
 A battle in the grave
.                     Em
 The war on death was waged
.                  C
 The power of hell forever broken

[B]
.G             D
 We sing hallelujah
.             Em
 We sing hallelujah
.              C
 We sing hallelujah
.                  G
 The Lamb has overcome</lyrics>
