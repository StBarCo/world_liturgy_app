  <title>How He Loves</title>
  <lyrics>[1]
.B
 He is jealous for me
.G#m
 Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree
.F#                                         E
 Bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy  ||
.B
 When all of a sudden
.                      G#m
 I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory ||
.  F#
 I realize just how beautiful You are
.        E
 and how great Your affections are for me

[P]
.B                   G#m
 Oh, how He loves us so
.          F#
 Oh how He loves us
.                E
 How He loves us all


[C]
.B
 He loves us
.          G#m
 Oh how He loves us
.          F#
 Oh how He loves us
.          E
 Oh how He loves

.B
 We are His portion and He is our prize
.G#m
 Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes
.F#                              E
 If grace is an ocean, we’re all sinking ||
.B
 So Heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss
.G#m
 And my heart turns violently inside of my chest ||
.F#
 I don’t have time to maintain these regrets
.E
 When I think about the way</lyrics>
