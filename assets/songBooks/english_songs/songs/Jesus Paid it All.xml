  <title>Jesus Paid it All</title>
  <lyrics>[1]
.  G           
 I hear the Saviour say
.    D                  G
 Thy strength indeed is small
.G                           C
 Child of weakness watch and pray
.        G        D      G
 Find in me thine all in all

[C]
.G             C
 Jesus paid it all
.G            D
 All to Him I owe
.G              C
 Sin had left a crimson stain
.   G          D       G
 He washed it white as snow
---

[2]
.     G
 Lord now indeed I find
.    D               G
 Thy power and thine alone
.    G                 C
 Can change the lepers spots
.    G        D        G
 And melt the heart of stone

[3]
.    G
 And when before the throne
.  D               G    
 I stand in him complete
.D/F#  Em              C
 Jesus died my soul to save
.   G          D       G
 My lips shall still repeat

[T1] 
.   G                  C
 Oh praise the one who paid my debt
.    G                   C
 And raised this life up from the dead

[T2] 
.   Em                 C
 Oh praise the one who paid my debt
.    G                   D
 And raised this life up from the dead
