The base repository for the World Liturgy (www.worldliturgy.org)family of apps.

The purpose of this app is to enable churches to easily create electronic versions of their liturgies, and song books in an accessible XML format. They can essentially be plugged into the World Liturgy framework and have an app.

* Prayer books with multiple services
* Multiple prayer books in multiple languages.
* Individual sections can be hidden, collapsed, or index and expanded on tap.
* Support for song books.
* User's ability to change font size.
* Integrated church calendar

### Future Features:
* Integrated lectionary with prayer services.
* Support for Bible texts and link with lectionaries.
* Support for searching within a service.


## XML Format for texts
Will be documented soon.
