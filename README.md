# world_liturgy_app

The base repository for the World Liturgy (www.worldliturgy.org)family of apps.

The purpose of this app is to enable churches to easily create electronic versions of their liturgies, and song books in an accessible XML format. They can essentially be plugged into the World Liturgy framework and have an app.


## Features
* Prayer books with multiple services
* Multiple prayer books in multiple languages.
* Individual sections can be hidden, collapsed, or index and expanded on tap.

### Future Features:
* Integrate church calendar and lectionary with prayer services.
* Support for Bible texts and link with lectionaries.
* Support for song books.
* Support for seaching within a service.
* User's ability to change font size.

## XML Format for texts
Will be documented soon.
